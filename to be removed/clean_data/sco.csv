Personal detailsBorn (1969-06-28) 28 June 1969 (age 54)Berkshire, England, United KingdomPolitical partyScottish ConservativesSpouseLauren ApfelChildren4Alma materUniversity of East AngliaLondon School of EconomicsProfessionLegal scholarAdam Tomkins (born 28 June 1969) is a British academic and politician who is the John Millar Professor of Public Law at the University of Glasgow School of Law. A member of the Scottish Conservatives, he was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region from 2016 to 2021, when he stood down for that year's elections.
Previously a constitutional advisor to the House of Lords Constitution Committee, he was made constitutional advisor to the Scotland Office and Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell in 2015. He was the Convener of the Justice Committee, having previously held the portfolio of strategy, communities, social security, the constitution and equalities.[1]
Academia[edit]
Tomkins was educated at Gillingham School, the University of East Anglia (LL.B., 1990) and the London School of Economics (LL.M., 1991).[2] He taught at the School of Law of King's College London between 1991 and 2000 and became a fellow at St Catherine's College, Oxford in 2000, before being elected to the John Millar Chair of Law at Glasgow in 2003.[2][3] His research interests lie in constitutional theory and history, British, EU and comparative constitutional law.[3]Tomkins has published seven books[2] in the areas of constitutional, administrative and European Union law, including two, Public Law (2003) and British Government and the Constitution (2007, with Colin Turpin), which are amongst the most widely used by law students in the United Kingdom.[4]Tomkins has held visiting appointments at the Universities of Toronto, Queensland and New South Wales and the Australian National University, and has lectured throughout the world.[4] In April 2009, Tomkins became associated with Ampersand, a stable at the Faculty of Advocates, as part of its Ampersand Academics link between practitioners and academics. Professor Douglas Brodie, former head of the School of Law at the University of Edinburgh, has also joined this project. In 2009 he was appointed legal adviser to the House of Lords Constitution Committee. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2014.[5]
Politics[edit]
During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum Tomkins was a leading unionist campaigner.[6]After the referendum Tomkins was one of two Scottish Conservative representatives appointed to the Smith Commission. He has also been appointed as unpaid adviser to Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell during the passage of the Scotland Bill through parliament.[7]In August 2015, Tomkins announced his intention to stand as a Member of the Scottish Parliament for the Scottish Conservatives in the 2016 election. In a blog explaining his decision, he was highly critical of the Scottish National Party's actions in government at Holyrood, and praised many policies of the Conservative government at Westminster.[8] He was elected a list member of the Scottish Parliament for the Glasgow Region in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[9] He previously sat on the Finance Committee and the Social Security Committee in the Scottish Parliament and then served as the Justice Committee convener. Between 2016 and August 2020, he served on the Scottish Conservatives Shadow Cabinet.[1][10] On 17 July 2020, Tomkins released a statement announcing his intention to stand down as an MSP at the next election due in May 2021 for personal reason related to work and family.[11]In April 2021, Tomkins wrote an article in The Spectator calling for a new law to define when constituent nations of the United Kingdom could hold independence referendums.[12] The call was criticised by the Scottish Greens and SNP.[13]

Personal detailsBorn (1980-05-18) 18 May 1980 (age 43)Perth, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySpouseGraham Fraser WhiteChildren2Alma materUniversity of GlasgowAileen Elizabeth Campbell (born 18 May 1980) is a Scottish football administrator and former politician who has served as the chief executive of Scottish Women's Football since 2021. A member of the Scottish National Party, she was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for fourteen years and was a Scottish Government minister for ten, having served on the Scottish Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, from 2018 to 2021. 
Born and raised in Perth, Campbell is a politics and history graduate of the University of Glasgow.[1][2] She served as the National Convenor of the SNP's youth wing from 2005 to 2006, and was an editor for the Keystone magazine. Before becoming an elected official, she worked for politicians like Nicola Sturgeon, Shona Robison and Stewart Hosie.[3][4] In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, she stood as the SNP's candidate for the Clydesdale constituency, but came second. Although she failed to win, Campbell was elected as an additional member for the South of Scotland region. In the 2011 election, she successfully defeated Scottish Labour's Karen Gillon in Clydesdale. 
After Campbell's re-election to the Scottish Parliament, she was appointed a junior minister in the Scottish Government as Minister for Local Government and Planning, a post she held for seven months. From 2011 to 2016, she served as Minister for Children and Young People. In December 2014, she became the first person to take maternity leave while serving as a minister in government.[5] After being re-elected in 2016, Campbell was appointed the role of Minister for Public Health and Sport.[6][7] In 2018, following a cabinet reshuffle, Campbell was promoted to Cabinet and served as Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government. In March 2020, she announced her intention to step down as an MSP, therefore relinquishing her role in government.[8]
Early life[edit]
Campbell was born on 18 May 1980 in Perth, Scotland. She grew up on her parents' tenant farm in Perthshire and was educated at Collace Primary School and Perth Academy.[1] She studied Politics and History at the University of Glasgow. From 2005−06 Campbell was national convener of the SNP youth wing, the Young Scots for Independence.[2] Since graduating, she has worked as editor of construction magazine Keystone and was editorial assistant on a short-lived pro-independence newspaper, the Scottish Standard. Before her election to Parliament, Campbell also worked for Nicola Sturgeon and as a researcher for Shona Robison and Stewart Hosie.[3][4]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011At the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Campbell was the SNP candidate for the Clydesdale constituency where she finished second but was subsequently elected as an additional member for the South of Scotland region due to her being fifth on the SNP's regional list.
Campbell suffered a minor injury on 23 January 2008, receiving medical treatment at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary before returning to the parliament for a vote.[9] The vote was won by 64 votes to 62.[10]In early 2009, Campbell launched the ""Play it again"" scheme with the Scottish Arts Council and others to encourage people across Scotland to donate their unwanted and unloved musical instruments to be passed on to children across the country to give them the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of music.[11][12] Campbell was nominated for Real Radio's ""Best New Scottish Politician 2009 Award"".[13]Campbell was elected as MSP for Clydesdale on 5 May 2011 after receiving an 8.9% swing from Labour, giving her a majority of 4,216.
She served as Minister for Local Government and Planning from 25 May 2011 until 6 December 2011.[14] when she was moved to the position of Minister for Children and Young People. On 18 December 2014, Campbell began maternity leave and Fiona McLeod acted as Minister for Children and Young People until Campbell returned on 1 September 2015. This was the first time that a Minister of the Scottish Government had taken maternity leave.[5]In the 2016 election she was re-elected as the MSP for Clydesdale with an increased majority.[7]
Help to buy a home, Nicola Sturgeon, Louisa Harper, Nicola Barclay and Campbell.On 18 May 2016 she was moved to the post of Minister for Public Health and Sport in a reshuffle;[6] as part of her role as Public Health Minister she oversaw a 22% cut in government funding to drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes from £69.2 million to £53.8 million. At the time, Scottish Drugs Forum Chief Executive David Liddell said he was concerned that the cuts had ""the potential to increase harm and drug-related deaths.""[15] That year 867 Scots lost their lives to drugs – an increase of 23% on the previous year's figures – and the SNP insisted it was part of a trend seen across much Europe.[16] In December 2020 figures were released revealing that 1,264 people in Scotland had died from drug overdoses in 2019 – the highest number in Europe per head and more than double the number in 2014.[17] Sturgeon sacked Campbell's successor as Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick and in April 2021 said of the crisis: ""I think we [the Scottish Government] took our eye off the ball.""[18]She was made Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government on 26 June 2018. Following her elevation to the cabinet The Times reported that her promotion, ""has bemused many. It was on her watch that the named person legislation, which has caused the SNP so much trouble, was introduced, while her record on drugs policy is regarded by many inside the party as deplorable.""[19]In February 2020 Campbell wrote to MSPs voicing concerns about a Labour party proposal to provide women and trans men in Scotland with free sanitary products. Campbell said the Scottish Government had “grave concerns” over the plans' “deliverability” and cost. She also said she was worried about ""people outside Scotland seeking access to the products"".[20]On 8 March 2020, she announced that she would step down at the next election to spend more time with her family.[8]
Football[edit]
After leaving politics, Campbell was appointed as chief executive of Scottish Women's Football, the governing body of women's football in Scotland, in August 2021. On her first day in the role, she had to deal with the withdrawal of Forfar Farmington F.C. from the Scottish Women's Premier League.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Campbell married Graham Fraser White in Collace Kirk, Perthshire, on 15 August 2009.[22]

Personal detailsBorn (1971-05-06) 6 May 1971 (age 52)Ashkirk, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materUniversity of AberdeenUniversity of GlasgowAlasdair James Allan (born 6 May 1971) is a Scottish politician serving as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Na h-Eileanan an Iar constituency since 2007. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he served as a Scottish Government from 2011 to 2018, first as Minister for Learning, Science and Scotland's Languages and then Minister for International Development and Europe.

Early life[edit]
Alasdair James Allan was born on 6 May 1971 in Ashkirk to Christine and John H. Allan.[2] Allan graduated from the University of Glasgow with an MA in Scottish Language and Literature, continuing his studies at the University of Aberdeen, graduating with a PhD in Scots language in 1998.[3]He devoted his time and employment to the Scottish National Party in Peterhead, working for Alex Salmond, the former First Minister of Scotland, and he subsequently became assistant to Michael Russell.[4] Previous to becoming an MSP, Alasdair was senior media relations officer for the Church of Scotland.[5]He is quadrilingual, and is able to speak: Scottish Gaelic, Norwegian, Scots and English.

Political career[edit]
Allan was the SNP candidate for Gordon at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election. As National Secretary of the SNP, he was responsible in July 2004 for the expulsion of Campbell Martin from the party after Martin had claimed that there was a case for supporters of independence not voting SNP.[6]Allan was next in line to become a list MSP for North East Scotland when Richard Lochhead resigned to fight the Moray by-election, however he decided instead to devote himself to contesting Na h-Eileanan an Iar, a key Labour–SNP marginal seat in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. He relocated to Lewis and resigned his post as SNP National Secretary.[7] This move proved successful, as he was elected with 46.6% of the vote – a 5.4% swing from Labour.
In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election Allan again stood for the SNP in the now renamed seat of Na h-Eileanan an Iar and increased his majority, returning to Holyrood with 65.3% of the vote, an increase of 18.7% and a swing of 15.8% from Labour.[8]As of July 2020, Allan is a member of the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints, the Education and Skills Committee and the Justice Committee of the Scottish Parliament.[9]He is a speaker and strong supporter of Scottish Gaelic and Scots and holds a PhD on the latter. He authored the booklet Talking Independence, which sought to answer questions about Scottish independence, ranging from ""What will I pay in tax?"" to ""Will I still be able to visit relatives in England?"" and ""Will we still get EastEnders?"".
Allan voted against same-sex marriage in Scotland, saying ""the view which so many of my constituents have expressed to me has a right to be recorded"" – in contrast to the position of the majority of the SNP government.[10]Allan wrote a book, Tweed Rins tae the Ocean (Tweed Runs to the Ocean), in response to claims made by former Conservative MP Rory Stewart that the Anglo-Scottish border was unnatural.[11] Allan walked the Border and recorded his travels, similar to what Stewart did for his book The Marches.[12]

Relatives include Anni Cole-Hamilton, founder of the private Moray Firth School, and Air Vice Marshal John Cole-Hamilton.[4][5] Cole-Hamilton's family moved from Lancashire to Scotland when he was 8 years old. After attending Madras College, a state school in St Andrews,[6] he graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a degree in politics and international relations. There, he was President of the Students' Representative Council from 1999 until 2000, where he was actively involved in negotiations with coalition ministers to abolish tuition fees in Scotland.
On leaving Aberdeen in 2000, he was appointed to the role of constituency organiser in the Liberal Democrat held constituency of Edinburgh West. He went on to work for the Liberal Democrats in the Scottish Parliament until late 2003 at which point he was appointed as a policy and communications officer in the Children’s voluntary sector, where he worked for various organisations until his election in 2016. During this time he was a Director of and then latterly the Convener of ""Together (Scottish Alliance for Children's Rights)"".[7]
Political career[edit]
Cole-Hamilton stood in several constituencies unsuccessfully as a Lib Dem candidate: at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election for the Kirkcaldy constituency;[8] at the 2005 general election for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath; in 2007 for Stirling[9] and in 2011 for Edinburgh Central.[10]Following the 2015 general election, Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg quoted Cole-Hamilton when delivering his resignation speech. He referred to the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, saying ""In 2011 after a night of disappointing election results for our party in Edinburgh, Alex Cole-Hamilton said this: if his defeat was part-payment for the ending of child detention, then he accepted it with all his heart. Those words revealed a selfless dignity which is very rare in politics, but common amongst Liberal Democrats.""[11]In May 2016, Cole-Hamilton was elected to the Scottish Parliament for the Edinburgh Western constituency.[12] After the election, he was made Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Health. Cole-Hamilton's 2016 electoral expenses were investigated in June of the following year,[13] according to the Edinburgh Evening News: ""Mr Cole-Hamilton recorded the highest election costs of any Edinburgh candidate, spending £32,549 on his campaign while his rival for the Edinburgh Western seat, SNP candidate Tony Giugliano, spent £18,593."" While Cole-Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing, the party was fined for failing to file an accurate spending return on its national spending return. He received the 'one to watch' award at the Herald – Scottish Politician of the Year Awards in August 2016.[14]In 2018, Cole-Hamilton successfully persuaded the Scottish Government to reverse a planned funding cut to HIV Scotland that would have sunk that organisation.[15] In 2020, during parliamentary deliberation of the first Coronavirus Act, Cole-Hamilton introduced amendments which forced a government U-turn on their proposals to abolish jury trials in Scotland for the duration of the emergency.[16]From 2019 until March 2021, he was a member of the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints against the former First Minister, Alex Salmond.[17]In February 2021, Cole-Hamilton was forced to apologise after having been seen swearing at Minister for Children and Young People Maree Todd during an online committee hearing.[18] He wrote Todd a letter of apology, as well as publicly apologising in the Holyrood Chamber the week after. 
At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Cole-Hamilton received 25,578 votes, the highest number of votes ever cast for a single candidate in the Scottish Parliament election. He beat the runner-up, SNP candidate Sarah Masson, by 9,885 votes.[19]On 27 July 2021, Cole-Hamilton announced his intention to stand in the upcoming Scottish Liberal Democrats leadership election to replace Willie Rennie.[20] He won the election unopposed on 20 August 2021 and took office the same day.[21] He led the party into the 2022 local elections, which saw an increase of 20 councillors to 87, and increased vote share to 8.7%.[22]He has prioritised campaigning on children's mental health, long covid, tackling the climate crisis and supporting Ukrainian refugees. He was sanctioned by the Kremlin in August 2022 following his public criticism of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,[23] and his efforts to highlight Russian influence in Scotland.
Cole-Hamilton spoke at an Oxford Union debate on Scottish independence on 24 February 2023. during which he compared the Yes movement with the push for Brexit. ""We are a people trapped between flags,"" he claimed. ""[B]etween politicians who mythologise and pine for ancient nations that can never and should never exist again in the global world in which we find ourselves."" Corri Wilson, deputy general secretary of the Alba Party, responded by saying: ""It will be no surprise to any independence supporter that Alex Cole-Hamilton doesn't support the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own future but the overwhelming majority of Scots will also reject his extraordinary view that Scotland should really not exist as a nation at all. Scotland, of course, is an ancient nation with a proud history, but in the here and now it is the tired arguments of Unionists like Alex Cole-Hamilton that have resulted in the new Alba Party now being well ahead in membership of the Liberals who have been around for 150 years.""[24]
Personal life[edit]
Cole-Hamilton is married to wife, Gillian, a teacher and Liberal Democrat candidate. They have three children.[25] In 2019, he resuscitated his daughter after she swallowed a 50c Euro coin. He used the publicity around this to raise awareness of the importance of infant first aid and organised several first aid training events in his constituency.[26]His relative John Cole-Hamilton was Provost of Kilwinning from 1940 until 1947, Deputy Lord Lieutenant for the County of Ayr in 1951, and Chairman of the Central Ayrshire Conservative Party when that constituency was formed, and Richard Cole-Hamilton, former chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank.[27]He ranked 27 out of 50 on the Top 50 Lib Dems of 2020 list.[28]

A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Airdrie and Shotts constituency from 2011  until his retirement in 2021.

Early life and education[edit]
Neil was born in Ayrshire Central Hospital, Irvine, the son of Margaret (née Gunning) and Alexander Neil Sr., a coalminer. He was brought up in Patna, Ayrshire, and became involved in Labour politics, joining the Labour Party in 1967, aged 16. He was educated at Ayr Academy, before attending the University of Dundee, where he studied economics. He served as chairman of the Scottish Organisation of Labour Students and later the UK-wide National Organisation of Labour Students.[1]
Political career[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating with an MA (Hons) degree in 1973,[2] Neil was appointed as the first-ever research officer for the Scottish Executive Committee of the Labour Party. In 1976, Neil, along with Jim Sillars and John Robertson, left the Labour Party to form a breakaway group, the Scottish Labour Party (SLP). Neil served as General Secretary of the SLP from 1976 to 1979. By 1979 the SLP had collapsed and Neil fell out of active politics until 1985 when he joined the Scottish National Party (SNP).[3]
SNP[edit]
Neil would go on to become the SNP's Publicity Director, and then in charge of the party's policy, as well as a candidate in the 1989 Glasgow Central by-election and candidate in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency in the 1992 and 1997 general elections.

Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
In 1999 he was elected SNP regional list MSP for Central Scotland in the first Scottish Parliament.
The following year he stood unsuccessfully in the hard-fought contest for the leadership of the SNP against John Swinney.[4] Thereafter he was appointed chair of the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, a role he kept on until 2003.
In 2003 he was re-elected as SNP MSP for Central Scotland to the Scottish Parliament.
In July 2004, Neil announced that he would not be a candidate in the impending contest for the leadership of the SNP, despite the fact that he believed he had considerable support within the party. He said that the reason for his decision was that senior figures in the party (such as MSP Fergus Ewing and former SNP leader Alex Salmond) had made it clear publicly that they would not work with him as leader.[5] Neil later endorsed Salmond, whom he claimed would ""unite the party"" and was ""best placed to maximise the SNP vote"".[4]In 2004 Neil was appointed chair of the Enterprise and Culture Committee. He was also a co-convenor of the Scottish Parliament's Cross-Party Group on the Scottish Economy.
Neil emerged as a leading supporter of former policewoman Shirley McKie as she bid to win compensation from the Scottish Government following her acquittal from perjury charges.[6][7][8]He was again re-elected as a regional MSP for Central Scotland in 2007. He sat on the European and External Relations Committee and the Finance Committee from 2007–2009, upon his promotion to Scottish Minister.
He voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, a choice he made less than two weeks before the vote, and is the only SNP MSP to publicly admit doing so.[9] ""I'd only recently left the SNP government and I wasn't going to rock the boat and I quite frankly didn't think it was all that important for me to say that at the time anyway,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""The party's position - the government's position - was very clear and quite frankly, out of loyalty, I didn't think it was right for me at that stage to say so.""[10]
Government Minister[edit]
In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government since it took office in 2007, Neil was appointed as the Minister for Housing and Communities in February 2009.[11] In 2011 Neil defeated Karen Whitefield in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency, gaining a majority of 2001, a 5.5% swing from Labour to SNP.[12] He was promoted to the Scottish Cabinet on 19 May 2011 by Alex Salmond to become the new Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment after the SNP's landslide win in the 2011 Scottish election.
He was moved from that post to the post of Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in September 2012. A month into this post, in an interview with Scotland on Sunday Neil spoke about the possibility of abortion laws being made in Scotland rather than Westminster, saying that politicians would have to consider the medical evidence.[13]In May 2014 Neil survived a vote of no confidence 57-67. Opposition MSPs had alleged he had acted improperly by cancelling changes to mental health provision when he took up his post as Health Secretary.[14] After Nicola Sturgeon became First Minister of Scotland in November 2014, Neil was appointed to the new post of Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, Communities and Pensioners' Rights. He resigned from the Government on 18 May 2016.[15]
Retirement[edit]
In August 2020 he announced that he would be standing down as an MSP at the upcoming 2021 Holyrood election. In a statement, he said: ""After much soul searching, I have decided that to commit to another five years as an MSP would mean not having the time to pursue all the other things in life I want to do. I also owe it to my wife and family to spend more time with them. I have two beautiful granddaughters who miss me when I am away so often on parliamentary and constituency business. I want to spend more time with them.""[16]In January 2023, Neil stated that Holyrood contained ""too many careerists"" and argued that reforms were needed to improve the quality of debate in the Chamber. He told The Scottish Sun: ""We have very few people in the Parliament, in any of the parties, who (are) prepared to stand up and act independently of their party leadership. I think any parliament worthy of the name has to encourage people who are dissenting voices, they’ve got to be given their view.""[17]
Awards[edit]
Neil was honoured three times in the Scottish Politician of the Year awards organised by The Herald newspaper. In 2005, he was named ""Donald Dewar Debater of the Year""; in 2017, he won the award in the ""Committee Member of the Year"" category; and in 2020, he was designated ""best of the best"" in the ""Donald Dewar Debater of the Year"" category.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Neil is married to Isabella Kerr and together they have one son.[2]

Personal detailsBorn (1963-11-30) 30 November 1963 (age 60)Dunfermline, Scotland, UKPolitical partyScottish LabourChildrenDanielleAlma materUniversity of EdinburghWebsiteOfficial websiteAlexander Andrew Penman Rowley (born 30 November 1963) is a Scottish politician who served as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2015 to 2017 and acting leader of the party from August to November 2017. He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 2014, firstly for the Cowdenbeath constituency and the Mid Scotland and Fife region since 2016. He has been described as being on the political left of the party.
Born in Dunfermline, Rowley studied community education at the University of Edinburgh before serving as General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party and a Fife councillor. First elected to the Scottish Parliament at a by-election in January 2014, he lost Cowdenbeath to Annabelle Ewing of the SNP at the 2016 election. However, he was returned as an additional member for Mid Scotland and Fife.
Following the resignation of Kezia Dugdale, he served as acting Leader of the Scottish Labour Party during the 2017 Scottish Labour leadership election. He served as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government from 2018 to 2019 and Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Brexit and Constitutional Relations from 2019 to 2020. He is currently Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity.

Early life[edit]
Born in Dunfermline and raised in Kelty, Rowley was educated at St Columba's High School in Dunfermline.[1] He studied for an MA Honours in sociology and politics at Newbattle Abbey College in Dalkeith and the University of Edinburgh and later for an MSc in community education at Edinburgh.[2]
Political career[edit]
Rowley was General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party for one year; from May 1998 to May 1999. He was first elected to Fife Regional Council in 1990 when he was Chairman of Finance, and he later became the first leader of the new Fife Council, a position he returned to in 2012 until his election to the Scottish Parliament in 2014.[citation needed]Prior to his election to the Scottish Parliament, Rowley was a Fife councillor (re-elected in 2007) and Labour Council Group Leader.[3] He worked as an education official with the TUC and worked for five years as an assistant, election agent and constituency manager to former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. On the political left-wing of the party, he was considered Brown's right-hand man and protégé.[4][5][6] He stood in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election as a Labour candidate for Dunfermline.

Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party[edit]
Rowley declared his candidacy for the Scottish Labour Party's 2015 deputy leadership election, and was supported in his candidacy by trade unions ASLEF, CWU, NUM, Scottish Co-Operative Party, Socialist Health Association, TSSA, UCATT, and UNISON. He comfortably won the first round preferences of votes from the labour party membership and secured victory with over half the votes in the second round of voting. He was elected on 15 August 2015.[7] Following Kezia Dugdale's resignation, he took over as acting Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, until the new leader was elected.[8]In September 2017, a leaked recording that was taken without permission and sold to The Scottish Sun of Rowley at the Brighton Labour Party Conference led to accusations of a plot to oust Dugdale and replace her with Richard Leonard. Rowley said he backed Leonard to become leader to a member of the public, as well as party member, in a conversation that turned out to be a freelance journalist secretly recording the conversation undercover. Rowley had stated he would remain neutral, however was unaware of being recorded by what turned out to be a journalist trying to sell a story. He apologised for the leaked recording, but strenuously denied being involved in or even aware of any plots within the labour party to remove Dugdale.[9]
Shadow Cabinet[edit]
Rowley was Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Communities and Local Government from October 2018 until September 2019.[10] During the 2019 Scottish budget process, Rowley was reprimanded by the Scottish Labour leader due to Rowley's personal discussions with the SNP Finance Secretary about supporting the budget in exchange for cuts to local government being substituted for Higher Education cuts in breach of Scottish Labour Party policy and undermining the budget spokesperson James Kelly.[11]Rowley became Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Brexit and Constitutional Relations in September 2019.[12] In November 2020, he was moved to the role of shadow economy minister.[13] He nominated Monica Lennon in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[14] After Anas Sarwar won the leadership election, he promoted Rowley to Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity.[15]
Personal life[edit]
Rowley has three grown-up children, and also has a granddaughter. He is the father of Danielle Rowley, who was elected as MP for Midlothian at the 2017 general election.
On 15 November 2017, Rowley resigned as deputy leader and referred himself to an internal investigation after a former partner took to the Scottish Sun to accuse him of sending her disrespectful text messages four years previously.[16] Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale and leadership candidate Anas Sarwar called for Rowley to be suspended from the party while the investigation was carried out.[17][18] Rowley claimed there was a determined attempt to use the media to damage him and his family for political purposes. The investigation concluded there was no case to answer as the party had not received a formal complaint. A party spokesperson added: ""The party was approached by newspapers with unsubstantiated claims, with no evidence shared with the Labour party prior to publication in the Sun newspaper.""[19]

^ Membership suspended briefly in 1982.

Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond (/ˈsæmənd/; born 31 December 1954) is a Scottish politician, economist and television host, who served as First Minister of Scotland from 2007 to 2014. A prominent figure in the Scottish nationalist movement, he has served as Leader of the Alba Party since 2021. Salmond was leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), on two occasions, from 1990 to 2000 and from 2004 to 2014. He served as the party's depute leader from 1987 to 1990. Salmond hosted The Alex Salmond Show (2017–2022) on RT UK. He currently hosts Scotland Speaks with Alex Salmond (2023–present). 
A graduate of the University of St Andrews, he worked as an economist in the Scottish Office, and later, the Royal Bank of Scotland. He was elected to the British House of Commons in 1987, serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Banff and Buchan from 1987 to 2010. In 1990, he successfully defeated Margaret Ewing in the SNP leadership contest. Salmond led the party through the first election to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, where the SNP emerged as the second largest party, with Salmond as the Leader of the Opposition. He was elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Banff and Buchan in that year's election. He resigned as leader in 2000 and stood down as an MSP the following year, when he was appointed leader of the SNP's Westminster group. Salmond was re-elected as leader of the SNP in the 2004 leadership contest, after running on a joint ticket with Nicola Sturgeon. She led the SNP at Holyrood until Salmond was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2007 for the Gordon (later Aberdeenshire East). The SNP placed first, ahead of the governing Labour Party in the 2007 election with Salmond securing a confidence and supply support from the Scottish Greens, resulting in Salmond's appointment as first minister.
Salmond led an SNP minority government in his first term. His government passed landmark legislation, including the abolishment of university tuition fees, the scrapping of prescription charges and commitment to renewable energy. Salmond was the first nationalist first minister and in his first term he failed to obtain support for a referendum on Scottish independence due to insufficient support. At the 2011 Scottish Parliament election the SNP won with an overall majority, a feat previously thought almost impossible under the additional member system used in elections for the Scottish Parliament. As of 2021, this is the only election in which a party has won a majority in the Scottish Parliament. Salmond used this mandate to hold a referendum, which led to the signing of the Edinburgh Agreement and the 2014 referendum. The Yes Scotland campaign, which his deputy Nicola Sturgeon led, was defeated in the referendum. As a result, Salmond resigned and was succeeded by Sturgeon.
Returning to Westminster, Salmond was elected MP for Gordon in the 2015 general election. He was the SNP International Affairs and Europe spokesperson from 2015 to 2017. He left the House of Commons at the 2017 general election after losing his seat to the Scottish Conservative Party candidate Colin Clark.[2] In August 2018, Salmond resigned from the party to fight allegations of rape and sexual assault, which he denied.[3] In January 2019, he was charged with 14 offences, including attempted rape and sexual assault, but was compensated £500,000 by the Scottish Government in August 2019 and later acquitted of all charges after trial in March 2020. In 2021, he criticised Sturgeon for her government's flawed investigations into these allegations which resulted in a political scandal. Salmond later was announced as the leader of a new pro-independence party, the Alba Party. The party failed to gain any seats in the 2021 national and 2022 local elections.

vteAlexander Elliot Anderson Salmond[4] was born in his parents' home at 101 Preston Road,[5]Linlithgow, West Lothian, Scotland, on 31 December 1954.[6] He is the second of four children born to Robert Fyfe Findlay Salmond (1921–2017) and Mary Stewart Salmond (née Milne; 1922–2003), both of whom were civil servants.[7] Robert Salmond, who served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War,[8] had originally worked as an electrician, and his family had been resident in Linlithgow since the mid-18th century.[9] Salmond's grandmother, Abigail Ireland, married Alexander Salmond, one of six children to Robert Dobie Salmond and Margaret Elms, the daughter of Margaret Duncan and Henry Elms, a native of England.[10]Salmond's middle names come from his family's tradition of naming their children after the local Church of Scotland minister, in this case Gilbert Elliot Anderson of St Ninian's Craigmailen Parish Church in Linlithgow.[11][12] He remains a member of the Church of Scotland.[13]From a young age, Salmond suffered very bad asthma.[14] His parents were loving and caring and although he did not grow up poor, ""money was tight"" and the importance of education was emphasised in the family.[14] Salmond was a skinny child, often referred to by his father as a ""skink"", as in Cullen Skink.[14]Salmond was educated at Linlithgow Primary School, before attending Linlithgow Academy from 1966 to 1972.[15] He studied at Edinburgh College of Commerce from 1972 to 1973, gaining an HNC in Business Studies,[16] and was then accepted by the University of St Andrews, where he studied Economics and Medieval History.[17] During his time at St Andrews, Salmond lived in Andrew Melville Hall.[18] He was elected as vice-president (education) of the students' representative council in 1977 and was also nominated to join St Andrews Community Council that year.[19] Salmond graduated with a 2:2 Joint Honours MA in Economics and Medieval History in May 1978.[19][20]
Early career[edit]
After graduating in 1978, he entered the Government Economic Service (GES) as an assistant economist in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, part of the now defunct Scottish Office. Two years later he joined the staff of the Royal Bank of Scotland, where he worked for seven years, initially as an assistant economist.[21] In 1982 he was appointed oil economist, and from 1984 he worked as a bank economist as well as continuing to hold the position of oil economist.[20] While with the Royal Bank, he wrote and broadcast extensively for both domestic and international outlets.[22] He also contributed regularly to oil and energy conferences. In 1983, Salmond created a ""Royal Bank/BBC oil index"" that is still used.[23]
Early political years[edit]
Salmond became active in the SNP when he joined the Federation of Student Nationalists at the University of St Andrews in 1973.[24] His conversion is generally credited to his then girlfriend, Debbie Horton, an English student from London, who was secretary of the St Andrews University Labour club. After an argument in December 1973, she told him: ""If you feel like that, go and join the bloody SNP"". The next day Salmond did.[19] The following day he and a friend attended the sparsely populated AGM of the university branch of the Federation of Student Nationalists. Being the only two fully paid-up members of the SNP at the university, they were duly elected president and treasurer.[19] Although a left-winger at the time he joined, Salmond had considerable doubts as to whether or not the Labour Government would legislate for a devolved Scottish Assembly.
Salmond started his political life as a committed left-winger inside the SNP and was a leading member of the socialist republican organisation within it, the 79 Group. He was, along with other group leaders, suspended from membership of the SNP when the 79 Group was banned within the larger party. In 1981, he married Moira French McGlashan,[25] then a senior civil servant with the Scottish Office.
Following the SNP's National Council narrowly voting to uphold the expulsion, Salmond and the others were allowed back into the party a month later, and in 1985 he was elected as the SNP's Vice Convener for Publicity. In 1987 he stood for Parliament in Banff and Buchan and defeated the incumbent Conservative MP, Albert McQuarrie. Later that year Salmond became Senior Vice Convener (Depute Leader) of the SNP. He was at this time still viewed as being firmly on the left of the party and had become a key ally of Jim Sillars, who joined him in the House of Commons when he won a by-election for the seat of Glasgow Govan in 1988. Salmond served as a member of the House of Commons Energy Select committee from 1987 to 1992.

Leadership of the Scottish National Party[edit]
First Tenure: 1990–2000[edit]
See also: 1990 Scottish National Party leadership election
When Gordon Wilson stood down as SNP leader in 1990, Salmond decided to contest the leadership. His only opponent was Margaret Ewing, whom Sillars decided to support. This caused considerable consternation amongst the SNP left as the two main left leaders were opposing each other in the contest. Salmond went on to win the leadership election by 486 votes to Ewing's 146.[26]His first test as leader was the general election in 1992, with the SNP having high hopes of making an electoral breakthrough. Whilst considerably increasing its share of the vote, it failed to win a large number of seats. Sillars lost his, causing him to describe the Scottish people as '90-minute patriots'. This comment ended the political friendship between Salmond and Sillars, and Sillars would soon become a vocal critic of Salmond's style of leadership.
The SNP increased its number of MPs from four to six in the 1997 general election, which saw a landslide victory for the Labour Party. After election, Labour legislated for a devolved Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. Although still committed to a fully independent Scotland, Salmond signed the SNP up to supporting the campaign for devolution, and, along with Scottish Labour leader Donald Dewar and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace, played an active part in securing the victory for devolution in the Scotland referendum of 1997. Many hardline fundamentalists in the SNP objected to committing the party to devolution, as it was short of full political Scottish independence.[27][28]Salmond's first spell as leader was characterised by a moderation of his earlier left-wing views and by his firmly placing the SNP into a gradualist, but still pro-independence, strategy. Salmond was one of the few politicians in the UK to oppose the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999.[29] He was opposed to the conflict because it was not authorised by a United Nations Security Council resolution, which was a controversial subject at the time. Despite this, Salmond was heavily criticised in the media for describing Tony Blair's decision to intervene militarily as an ""unpardonable folly"".[30]Several years as party leader earned Salmond an unusually high profile for an SNP politician in the London-based media. In 1998, Salmond won the Spectator Award for Political Strategist of the Year. Following an appearance on the entertainment programme Call My Bluff, Salmond used one of the 'bluff' cards that are used as props in the show in the run-up to the first elections to the Scottish Parliament. To counter his frustration at having to sit in silence through what he claimed was an inappropriately political speech by Tony Blair at a charity lunch, he held up the bluff card as the Prime Minister began querying Scotland's economic prospects should independence occur.[31] Throughout his time in politics, Salmond has maintained his interest in horse racing, writing a weekly column for The Scotsman and appearing a number of times on Channel 4's The Morning Line. During the election campaign, Salmond was photographed feeding a young supporter a Solero ice cream during an event at Stirling University, creating a photograph that would become iconic.[32][33][34]
Resignation as leader[edit]
Salmond was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and was one of its highest-profile members as Leader of the Opposition. He stood down as SNP leader in 2000, facing internal criticism after a series of high-profile fall-outs with party members,[35] and was replaced by his preferred successor John Swinney, who defeated Alex Neil for the post. He resigned from the Scottish Parliament on 14 May 2001 to lead the SNP group in the House of Commons.[36]During the prolonged parliamentary debates in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq he voiced strong opposition to the UK's participation. In the aftermath of the war, he lent support to the attempt of Adam Price, a Plaid Cymru MP, to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq issue. Salmond has gone further than many anti-war politicians in claiming that Blair's statements on the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were consciously intended to deceive the public.[37] He has also claimed that Blair had made a pact with George W. Bush ""to go to war come what may"".[37]
Subsequent return[edit]
See also: 2004 Scottish National Party leadership election
Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon at the launch of the National Conversation, 2007After the June 2004 European Parliament elections, which were perceived as a ""disaster"" for the SNP, pressure mounted on Swinney to resign as leader. Swinney announced his resignation on 22 June 2004 to become Convener of the Scottish Parliament's European and External Relations Committee.
On 15 July 2004, Salmond said that he would be a candidate in the forthcoming election for the leadership of the SNP.[38] This came as a surprise because he had previously declared that he would definitely not be a leadership candidate.[38] In the postal ballot of all members he went on to receive over 75% of the votes cast, placing him well ahead of his nearest rival Roseanna Cunningham. As he was not an MSP at the time, his depute, Nicola Sturgeon, took over as Leader of the SNP group and the main opposition leader at Holyrood.[39] Although he was re-elected in the 2005 general election, he made clear his intention to return to the Scottish Parliament at the 2007 Scottish parliamentary election in an attempt to win power for the first time.[39]
2007 Scottish Parliament election[edit]
Salmond led the Scottish National Party through the 2007 election to the 3rd Scottish Parliament. In the election, Salmond stood as a candidate for the Gordon constituency, which had been represented since 1999 by the Liberal Democrat Nora Radcliffe.[40] Salmond won the seat with 41% of the vote, and a majority of 2,062, returning to the Scottish Parliament after six years' absence. In the election the SNP emerged as the largest party, winning 47 seats to Labour's 46.
Having won more seats than any other party in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP initially approached the Scottish Liberal Democrats to form a coalition, but they declined to take part in negotiations.[41] This left the SNP without any possibility to form a coalition with an overall majority. Ultimately, the Scottish Green Party agreed to vote in an SNP minority government in return for concessions on climate policy and naming a Green to chair a committee.[42]
First Minister of Scotland[edit]

See also: First Salmond government
On 16 May 2007, with the support of the Greens, Salmond was elected by the Parliament to succeed Jack McConnell as First Minister of Scotland.[43] The following day he received the Royal Warrant from the Queen and was officially sworn into office at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.[44] Under section 45(7) of the Scotland Act 1998 he became Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland at the same time.[45] He was appointed to the British Privy Council four weeks later.[46] Salmond became the first nationalist politician to hold the office of First Minister. He appointed Sturgeon as his Deputy First Minister.

Entering government[edit]
Salmond at the opening of the 3rd Scottish Parliament with Elizabeth II, 2007Salmond reduced the size of the Cabinet from nine members to six, and said he would seek to govern on a ""policy by policy"" basis.[43] In order to concentrate on his new role as First Minister, Salmond stood down as the SNP group leader at Westminster and was replaced by Angus Robertson.[47]The Guardian reported in November 2007 that Salmond believed Scotland would be independent within ""the next decade"".[48]
2007 Glasgow Airport attacks[edit]
Further information: 2007 Glasgow Airport attack
Salmond had been First Minister for just over a month when a vehicle rammed the front entrance of the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport on 30 June 2007, the first terrorist attack in Scotland since the Lockerbie bombing incident in December 1988.[49] In a statement addressing the attacks in Glasgow, Salmond stated ""terrorist acts are the work of individuals not communities and the arrival of terror on our soil must not result in racist attacks on ethnic minorities whose only crime is to share the same religion and colour as the bombers. It is to be hoped that yesterday's attack is an isolated incident, but the reality is that we will have to deal with more in the future. We must not allow terrorists to stop us from going about our lives as we always have – to do so would be to hand a victory to the men of terror.""[49]Salmond issued a statement regarding the attacks in Edinburgh, calling for ""the need for vigilance and unity against the forces of terror and rightly praised the work of the emergency services"".[49] Salmond called a meeting of the Scottish Government security advisers in St Andrew's House in Edinburgh, followed by a request from the Prime Minister Gordon Brown for Salmond, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill and the Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini to attend an emergency COBRA meeting.[50] By the evening of 30 June, Salmond had attended an online conference discussion with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown and his governmental cabinet.[49]
Scottish Independence proposals[edit]
Salmond meets with Carrie Lam, Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong KongA white paper for an independence referendum, setting out four possible options ranging from no change to full independence, was published by the Scottish Government on 30 November 2009. A draft bill for public consultation was published on 25 February 2010, setting out a two-question yes/no referendum, proposing further devolution or full independence. The SNP failed to obtain support from other parties and withdrew the draft bill.

Expense controversy[edit]
A newspaper investigation in 2009 revealed that Salmond had claimed as expenses from the UK parliament ""up to £400 per month in food without producing receipts, even after becoming First Minister and spending little time at Westminster"".[51] In the same year, he stated that he would repay more than £700 that he had received in moving expenses when he left a London flat in 2007.[52]
2010 UK General Election debates[edit]
Salmond said it would be ""unacceptable""[53] for the SNP to be excluded from the 2010 UK election televised debate and sought ""guarantees of inclusion from the broadcasters, given their inescapable duty to ensure fairness and impartiality in election-related coverage in Scotland"" in the build up to the 2010 UK general election. The party used the Freedom of Information Act to see whether the BBC could have broken its own rules. Salmond said it was unacceptable to Scotland as well as to the SNP for the broadcasters to exclude the party that formed the Scottish Government and was leading in Westminster election polls. He emphasised that he was not trying to stop any debates from being broadcast.[54] After having failed to change the BBC's decision to not include the SNP in the final British debate, in line with the decision by ITV and Sky News, the SNP mounted a legal challenge to the BBC at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. Despite earlier reassurances by the SNP that it was not trying to stop the broadcast, it sought an 'interim interdict' to prevent the debate being broadcast without the participation of the SNP. The Court of Session dismissed the SNP's complaint, and refused to ban the BBC from broadcasting the third debate in Scotland, on the grounds that the SNP had left the bringing of the case ""far too late"", had not contested the broadcasting of the first two debates by ITV and Sky Television, and that the third debate would in any case be broadcast by Sky on satellite across Britain, which a Scottish court had no power to block. The judge ordered the SNP to pay the BBC's legal expenses. The SNP's political opponents described the SNP's contesting of the case as a ""stunt"".[55]There were Scottish debates dealing with specifically devolved issues which Salmond had accepted the invitation to attend along the other parties within the Scottish Parliament on Sky TV. Salmond declined to attend those held on the BBC and ITV, and Angus Robertson agreed to take his place in the other debates.[56]
Renewable energy[edit]
Salmond and Li Keqiang, Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China at a special reception in the Great Hall, Edinburgh Castle.Salmond in his 2010 New Year message highlighted the importance of sustainable development and renewable energy in Scotland and the required increase in powers of the Scottish Parliament needed to help harness Scotland's green energy potential and therefore take full advantage of the ""renewable revolution"".[57]Earlier, in December 2009, he campaigned for climate change legislation at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen to promote Scotland's role in tackling and mitigating climate change. This included signing a Partnership Agreement with the Maldives, one of the most exposed countries to the consequences of rising sea levels.[58][59]Although energy is mostly a matter reserved to Westminster, administrative devolution of Sections 36 & 37 of the Electricity Act 1989 coupled with fully devolved planning powers enabled the Scottish Government to establish Scotland as a leader in renewable energy developments.

2011 Scottish Parliament election[edit]
Before the 2011 Scottish election, the SNP again pledged to hold an independence referendum if it won another term.[60][61]  The Westminster Labour government had initially designed the additional member system to make it impossible for one party to win an outright majority, but the SNP won enough seats from the other parties to take 69 seats, a majority of four. At this election, Salmond was re-elected for Aberdeenshire East, essentially a reconfigured version of Gordon.

Second term: 2011–2014[edit]
Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon at a press conference for the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, 2012The SNP's overall majority assured Salmond of another term as First Minister, and he was re-elected unopposed on 18 May 2011.[62] It also gave Salmond the ability to call a referendum on Scottish independence.  On 10 January 2012, the Scottish Government announced that they intended to hold the referendum in late 2014.[63]On 7 November 2012, Salmond surpassed the 2,001-day term of his predecessor, Jack McConnell.[64]An agreement was signed on 15 October 2012 by David Cameron and Salmond which provided a legal framework for the referendum to be held,[65] and on 21 March 2013 the SNP government announced that the referendum would be held on 18 September 2014.[66]Scotland's Future, a white paper setting out the Scottish Government's vision for an independent Scotland, was published on 26 November 2013.[67][68]
Spending criticism[edit]
Salmond during a visit to the United States in 2012, pictured with Mayor of Chicago Rahm EmanuelIn December 2011, Salmond spent £260 on a pair of trews that he wore to a ball in China.[51] He refunded the taxpayer more than a year later, after a newspaper had submitted a freedom of information request.[51] The sequence in which these events occurred was acknowledged by the Scottish Government after 7 months, during which they initially maintained that they had no record of when Salmond had repaid the money.[51] In September 2012 he stayed with his wife at a hotel in Chicago while attending a golf tournament; the £3,000 for four nights was paid for by the taxpayer and supported a VisitScotland delegation[69] that spent £468,580 on the trip as part of preparations for hosting the same tournament two years later.[70] Salmond responded to a freedom of information request for information on his spending six months after receiving it, and referred to it as ""ridiculous frippery"".[69]In 2012, Salmond indicated in a television interview that he had sought the advice of his law officers on whether an independent Scotland would be part of the European Union.[51][71] The following year, it was revealed that the Scottish Government had spent almost £20,000 to prevent the disclosure of the content of the alleged legal advice, even though no such advice existed.[71]Salmond has faced scrutiny for his closeness to Rupert Murdoch.[72][73][74]
Donald Trump[edit]
Salmond was an early supporter of then-future US President Donald Trump's controversial plans for a Trump International golf course in Aberdeenshire. After the plans were rejected by Aberdeenshire council Salmond personally met with Trump Organisation executives in Aberdeen. The next day the decision was made to overrule the council's rejection. The relationship turned fractious when in 2015, the UK Supreme Court rejected Trump's bid to stop an offshore wind farm being built close to one of his two golf resorts in Scotland. Trump has twice lost bids in the Scottish courts to halt the development, leading Salmond to describe him as a ""three times loser"", to which Trump called Salmond a ""totally irrelevant has-been"".[75] Salmond has also said that Trump's impact in Scotland – in particular Turnberry, the Ayrshire golf resort he bought in 2014 – has had a ""damaging impact"" on the Scottish economy.[76] These comments came days after the chief executive of the Professional Golfer's Association said Trump's comments on the presidential campaign trail were ""not a positive thing for golf"".[76]In January 2016, Salmond, prompted by broadcasting colleague Iain Dale, called Trump a ""chicken"" for refusing to appear on his LBC talk show, which had then been recently launched. Of Trump, he said: ""The Donald tries to give this impression that he's totally off the cuff; in fact his media operation controls him and protects him from tough interviews, and when he's had tough interviews he hasn't liked it, that's been pretty obvious"".[77]
Edinburgh Agreement[edit]
Main article: Edinburgh Agreement (2012)
Salmond and David Cameron sign the Edinburgh Agreement at St Andrews House, 2012An agreement was signed on 15 October 2012 by David Cameron and Salmond which provided a legal framework for the referendum to be held,[65] and on 21 March 2013 the SNP government announced that the referendum would be held on 18 September 2014.[66]Scotland's Future, a white paper setting out the Scottish Government's vision for an independent Scotland, was published on 26 November 2013.[67][68]
Resignation as First Minister[edit]
See also: 2014 Scottish independence referendum
On 19 September 2014, following the results of the independence referendum which confirmed a majority of the Scottish people had voted against independence, Salmond announced that he would be resigning as First Minister in November 2014.[78] On 15 October, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was the only candidate to stand for the leadership, and formally succeeded Salmond as SNP leader following the party's national conference in Perth on 14 November.[79][80] Salmond submitted his resignation as First Minister to the Scottish Parliament and to the Queen on 18 November, and the formal selection of Sturgeon as his successor by the Scottish Parliament took place the following day.[81][82]
My time as leader is nearly over, but for Scotland, the campaign continues and the dream shall never die.— Alex Salmond
Post-premiership[edit]
Return to Westminster, 2015–2017[edit]
On 7 December 2014, Salmond announced that he would stand as the SNP candidate for the Westminster constituency of Gordon in the 2015 May election.[83] He indicated that he did not intend to replace Angus Robertson, MP for Moray, as the SNP leader in the House of Commons.[83][84] Nicola Sturgeon, his successor as SNP leader and First Minister, repeatedly reminded voters at the March 2015 SNP conference that she, not he, was party leader after he gave interviews about his possible role in a hung parliament.[85] After he declared his candidacy, he was described as a ""bogeyman"" (both by Lesley Riddoch[86] and by himself[87]), and was reportedly ""demonised"" by ""Conservative propaganda"" portraying Labour Party leader Ed Miliband ""compliantly dancing to Salmond the piper's tune"" after the election.[88]During the election campaign, Salmond recorded in his diary: ""The Tory candidate, Colin Clark, cuts an impressive figure but his politics are far too dry for this area. If the constituency were composed entirely of michty fairmers then he might be the ideal candidate. But it isn't and he is not.""[89]
Salmond at the Festival Interceltique Lorient, 2017Salmond gained the seat of Gordon with 47.7% of the vote, replacing the Liberal Democrat Malcolm Bruce as the constituency's Westminster MP
.[90] On 13 May 2015, Salmond was appointed as the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman in the House of Commons. He tweeted that the party would advocate a ""pro Europe"", ""pro developing world"" and ""against military adventurism"" stance.[91]Following his return to the Commons he attracted media attention after telling Business Minister Anna Soubry during a debate, ""Behave yourself, woman."" Soubry said Salmond's attitude belonged ""firmly in the 19th century"". However, his then party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, defended the remarks and said, ""It was in a boisterous House of Commons debate. The fundamental question, 'does that language indicate that Alex Salmond is sexist?' Absolutely not, there's no man I know who is less sexist.""[92][93]In the 2017 British general election, Salmond's seat was widely watched as a potential Tory gain amid a nationwide backlash to Sturgeon's decision to call for a second independence referendum.[94] The Scottish Conservatives had taken the most votes in the area at the 2017 local council elections, prompting party leader Ruth Davidson to say on a visit to Inverurie that, ""We won the local government election in Gordon this week, beating the SNP into second place. It means that in this seat, as in many others, it is a two-horse race between us and the nationalists.""[95] In response to Davidson's comments, Salmond riposted, ""It's just arrogance, for Ruth Davidson to continue the line of 'we're going to take this seat, and we're going to take that seat'. Once it doesn't happen, it's very bad news for Ruth Davidson's credibility.""[96]On election night, Salmond lost his seat as member for Gordon to Colin Clark of the Conservatives, receiving 19,254 votes to the Conservatives' 21,861. This represented a swing of 20.4% away from Salmond, larger than the 14.4% swing to him from the Liberal Democrats which saw him win the seat in the 2015 election. It also marked first time since the 1987 general election that Salmond was not in an elected position in either the British or Scottish parliament.[2]
The Alex Salmond Show[edit]
Main article: The Alex Salmond Show 
On 9 November 2017, the RT channel (formerly known as Russia Today) announced he would host a show called The Alex Salmond Show on the network. Salmond's successor as Scotland's first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said she would have advised against his decision to broadcast for the channel. Salmond was criticised by Scottish politicians from the other parties for a perceived lack of judgement.[97] The first show was broadcast on 16 November 2017; the main interviewee was Carles Puigdemont, the former president of Catalonia.[98]In February 2022, Salmond announced that his show on RT had been suspended, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[99]
Scotland Speaks with Alex Salmond[edit]
On 11 July 2023, more than a year after The Alex Salmond Show ended, Salmond started a new show on all social media platforms, Scotland Speaks with Alex Salmond, seen as a natural successor to The Alex Salmond Show that was also hosted by Salmond and Ahmed-Sheikh and produced by Slainte Media. It first aired on 13 July 2023 and featured a similar format to the show albeit having a smaller budget and studio.[100][101]
Sexual misconduct allegations and subsequent investigations[edit]
Main article: Alex Salmond scandal
Trial and acquittal[edit]
Main article: HM Advocate v Salmond
In August 2018, he resigned from the SNP in the face of allegations of sexual misconduct in 2013 while he was First Minister. In a statement he said that he wanted to avoid internal division within the party and intended to apply to rejoin the SNP once he had an opportunity to clear his name.[102][3]On 30 August 2018, he launched a crowdfunding appeal to pay for the legal costs of seeking a judicial review into the fairness of the process by which the Scottish Government has handled the allegations.[103] He closed the appeal two days later, on 1 September, after raising £100,000, double the amount he wanted to pay for his legal costs.[104] The government later conceded that its procedures had been flawed and paid more than £500,000 in Salmond's legal expenses.[105] On 8 January 2019, he won his inquiry case against Scottish government, noting, ""while I am glad about the victory which has been achieved today, I am sad that it was necessary to take this action."" The Scottish government admitted it breached its own guidelines by appointing an investigating officer who had ""prior involvement"" in the case. Salmond also asked permanent secretary to the Scottish Government, Leslie Evans, to consider her position. Evans stated that the complaints the government had received in January 2018 had not been withdrawn, so the option of re-investigating them remained on the table, once the police probe into the allegations had run its course.[106]On 24 January 2019, Police Scotland arrested Salmond, and he was charged with 14 offences, including two counts of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault, and one of breach of the peace.[107][108] He appeared in court on 21 November and entered a plea of ""not guilty"". The trial started on 9 March 2020; his defence was led by Gordon Jackson, and the prosecution was led by Alex Prentice.[105]On 23 March 2020, Salmond was cleared of all charges. A jury found him not guilty of 12 charges, one charge was dropped by prosecutors earlier in the trial while one charge was found not proven.[109][110]In May 2021 The Times reported that Salmond was writing a book about his trial.[111]
Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints[edit]
Main article: Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment ComplaintsThe Scottish Parliament set up the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints[112] to investigate how the Government breached its own guidelines in its original investigation into the harassment claims against Salmond, and then lost a judicial review into their actions and had to pay over £500,000 to Salmond for legal expenses.[113] A political row developed over what evidence to this committee Salmond could present.[113] Giving evidence in person in February 2021, Salmond claimed that senior figures in the Scottish Government and the SNP plotted to remove him from public life and to send him to prison.[114][115] Sturgeon disputed the allegations.[114][115]Sturgeon initially told parliament that she had first heard of the complaints against Salmond when he told her of them on 2 April 2018.[113] However, 18 months later, she revised her account, saying she had forgotten about an earlier meeting, on 29 March 2018, in which Salmond's former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein told her about the complaints.[113] Critics have described this as a possible breach of the ministerial code, which states that any minister who deliberately misleads parliament should resign.[113] The 29 March meeting was not recorded: meetings on government business are meant to be recorded, but Sturgeon has said this is because it was an SNP meeting.[113] In his evidence to the committee, Salmond said there was ""no doubt"" that Sturgeon had broken the ministerial code in not revealing the 29 March meeting sooner and in not recording what was really a meeting about government business.[113] Sturgeon denies any wrongdoing.[113]Documents and emails published on 2 March 2021 showed that two people supported Salmond's assertion that the meeting was convened as a government, not party, matter.[116] The publication also backed up Salmond's allegation that the identity of one of his accusers had been passed to his former chief of staff, contradicting Sturgeon's statement that ""to the very best of my knowledge I do not think that happened"".[116] They also confirmed that the government had pursued the legal case against Salmond after being advised by lawyers that it was likely to fail.[116]The Times reported that MSPs also heard that staff felt, ""shamed because they were expected to tie Salmond's shoelaces, straighten his tie, apply hand sanitiser to him and comb his hair and remove dandruff.""[117]Irish lawyer James Hamilton conducted a separate investigation into whether Sturgeon breached the ministerial code and concluded that she did not, with the caveat that: ""It is for the Scottish parliament to decide whether they were in fact misled"".[118]
Alba Party[edit]
On 26 March 2021, Salmond announced he had joined and become leader of the Alba Party, a new pro-independence party, to contest the upcoming 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[119][120] While campaigning, he told The New Yorker that he did not want to destroy Nicola Sturgeon. ""If I wanted to destroy her, that could have been done,"" he claimed.[121] The party won zero seats but Salmond pledged the party would continue campaigning. He also claimed that the party had established itself as a political force in only six weeks and would remain on the political scene.[122]Alba also fielded 111 candidates at the 2022 Scottish local elections, including thirteen who had defected since 2017, but none of them won a seat.[123] The following week, Salmond stated that all pro-independence parties needed to work together if Scottish independence was to be achieved. He said that the proposed 2023 independence referendum would need to take place, but if it did not, then there would be huge political change in Scotland, in which Alba would play a strong part.[124]
Personal life[edit]
Salmond married Moira McGlashan in 1981. Moira was a senior civil servant 17 years his senior, and became his boss when he joined the Scottish Office in the 1970s. They have no children.[125] They closely protect their private lives[6] and live in a converted mill in Strichen, Aberdeenshire.[125]Salmond is a member of the Church of Scotland and considers himself to be a religious man.[126]Salmond's main interests outside of work and politics are golf, horse racing, football and reading.[127] He succeeded Robin Cook as a racing tipster for Glasgow's Herald newspaper. He supports the Scotland national football team and Heart of Midlothian FC,[128] and sometimes attends matches. He takes an interest in Scottish cultural life, as well as watching Star Trek and listening to country music.[129]
Honorary degrees and awards[edit]
Salmond has been awarded several honorary degrees in recognition of his political career. These include a doctorate from the University of St Andrews on 30 November 2007[130] and he was awarded the degree of Doctor of the University (D.Univ.) of the University of Glasgow on 20 April 2015.[131]In November 2007, Salmond received The Spectator's Parliamentarian of the Year award for his ""brilliant campaign"" and ""extraordinary victory"" in the Scottish Parliament elections, thereby ending eight years of Labour rule.[132]

Well if a bogeyman sells papers or enlivens the General Election in England – any excuse will be used to build up his potency. And there is no doubt the former SNP leader is that bogeyman.

So, why is Mr Salmond the one grinning almost five months later? The answer is that the self-proclaimed ""bogeyman of the British establishment"" thinks that the nationalists are about to destroy Labour in Scotland and, by holding the balance of power at Westminster in the event of a hung parliament, broker Scottish independence or something very close to it.

""You should never put your opponent – any opponent – on one of your posters,"" Salmond replies when I ask about the posters. ""What government puts the leader of the opposition outside Downing Street? As leader of the opposition you should be unbelievably pleased. It's the concession of the election.

Family and background[edit]
Alexander Burnett is the son of James Comyn Amherst Burnett of Leys, Chief of the Name and Arms of the House of Burnett, and Fiona Mercedes Phillips. His mother Fiona is the daughter of Harold Phillips and Georgina, Lady Kennard, and a sister of the Duchesses of  Abercorn and Westminster.[1] Burnett is a fourth-great-grandson of Nicholas I of Russia on his mother's side, and through the same line also claims descent from the Russian noblemen Abram Petrovich Hannibal and Alexander Pushkin.[2] He was educated at Eton College and Newcastle University, where he graduated with an LL.B.

Career[edit]
After graduating Burnett worked for a decade in Azerbaijan,[3] before returning to Scotland where he started a number of businesses with his family, including property developer North Banchory Limited and its biomass renewable energy subsidiary Hill of Banchory ESCo Limited (HoBESCo).[4] Aside from this, Burnett is also the owner of an estate in Aberdeenshire, and the beneficiary of a couple of property-owning trusts, that in total have an estimated value of almost £30 million.[4]Burnett stood as the Conservative Party's candidate in the West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine consistency in the 2015 general election, losing the seat to the SNP's Stuart Donaldson, receiving 28.8% of the vote compared to Donaldson's 41.6%.[5]In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election Burnett stood as the Conservative Party candidate for the Aberdeenshire West constituency and won the seat with 38.1% of the vote, unseating the incumbent candidate SNP candidate Dennis Robertson who only received 35.5%.[6] Burnett has been re-selected by the Scottish Conservatives as the candidate for Aberdeenshire West in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.
The Scottish Parliament's cross-party Standards Committee unanimously found that Burnett had broken the Parliament's code of conduct by submitting written questions while failing to indicate a financial interest in mid-September 2017, but did not apply any sanctions.[4] However two weeks later the Committee again found that Burnett had broken the code of conduct in a similar way,[7] and sanctioned the MSP by banning him from asking written questions for two weeks.[8]Burnett is the Conservative spokesperson for energy in the Scottish Parliament.[9] He sits on the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee of the Scottish Parliament.[10]At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election Burnett was re-elected for Aberdeenshire West with an increased majority of 3,390 votes as his vote share rose by 9.1%.[11]The Scotsman reported that the seat had been forecast to produce a close contest and his holding of it was seen as ""a significant blow to the hopes of an outright SNP majority"" in the Scottish Parliament as a result of the election.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Burnett is married to Lavinia Cox, with whom he has a son and two daughters.

Elected as a member of the Scottish Greens, she relinquished her party affiliation on becoming Presiding Officer.[2] She has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothian region since 2011.[4]Johnstone was born and raised in Edinburgh, where she attended St. Augustine's High School.[5] She worked as an assistant to Robin Harper, the first ever elected Green Party politician in the UK. In 2007, Johnstone was nominated unopposed as co-convenor of the Scottish Greens, serving alongside Harper. The same year she was elected to the City of Edinburgh Council, representing the Meadows/Morningside ward until 2012. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, she was elected as an additional member of the Lothian region. Following the 2019 Scottish Green co-leadership election, Johnstone served as the co-leader within the Scottish Parliament, until the 2021 election.
Following the election to the 6th Scottish Parliament, Johnstone was the only candidate to run for Presiding Officer. She received 97 votes in-favour and was elected unopposed as Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. Johnstone is the second female and first Green Party member to hold the position of office.

Early life[edit]
Johnstone was born on 11 October 1965 in Edinburgh, Scotland, where she attended St. Augustine's High School.[5] She is a qualified athletics coach and board member of Scottish Athletics, and formerly held the East of Scotland 800m and 1500m records.[2] She worked at Basil Paterson College as a registrar for a decade.[6]
Early political involvement[edit]
Johnstone began to have an interest in politics in the mid-1990s, when she joined the Keep Meggetland Green, a campaign against a proposal for flats to be built on Meggetland Playing Fields. She wrote to politicians to gain attention, with Green politicians Robin Harper and Gavin Corbett the only ones to respond. Although the campaign was unsuccessful, Johnstone attended a Green party conference as a non-member and became more involved in politics.[6]She was a member of Scotland FORward and campaigned in-favour of a devolved Scottish Parliament.[6] Following Harper's election to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, Johnstone served as his parliamentary assistant until 2011.

Political career[edit]
City of Edinburgh Councillor[edit]
Johnstone (Middle) with then Green Party of England and Wales leader, Natalie Bennett (left), and Maggie Chapman (right).Johnstone first stood as Scottish Green candidate in the 2003 North Morningside by-election, but finished third, gaining 10% of the vote, ahead of the SNP and Scottish Labour. With Single Transferable Vote now being adopted in Scottish local elections, Johnstone saw an opportunity for Greens to enter local government. She stood as the candidate for Edinburgh's Meadows/Morningside ward in the 2007 local elections. After a successful campaign, she was elected to the City of Edinburgh Council, becoming one of three Green politicians to be elected into local government.[6] She did not stand for re-election in the 2012 local elections after being elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament for the Lothian region in the 2011 election.
Following the Scottish Greens' poor performance at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, she was nominated unopposed as co-convener of the Scottish Greens.[7] Johnstone was ""certain that the Green Party will grow and attract more support as the other parties reveal themselves to lack the ambition to really change course from business as usual when it comes to the crunch"". She served alongside Robin Harper, and both were replaced in 2008 as co-conveners by Patrick Harvie and Eleanor Scott.

Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Johnstone was elected as an additional member for the Lothian region.

Johnstone at AJ Divest Rally, 2015She unsuccessfully contested Edinburgh Central in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election but finished fourth behind the Scottish Conservatives' Ruth Davidson, the Scottish National Party's Alison Dickie and Scottish Labour's Sarah Boyack.[8] She was again returned on the regional list.[9] On 22 May, she was announced as the Scottish Greens spokesperson on Health and Sport, Social Security, Children and Young People.[10]She served as Co-Leader of the Scottish Greens in the Scottish Parliament, serving with Patrick Harvie from March 2019 to May 2021.[11] In 2020, she introduced a measure to grant protected species status to the mountain hare in Scotland, which was accepted on 17 June 2020.[12]Johnstone previously represented the Green Party at First Minister's Questions and in September 2019 sketch writer Stephen Daisley commented, ""Going by her performance at First Minister's Questions, they [the Greens] should dump the rest and put her in charge full-time. Unlikely as it sounds, she was the star of this week’s FMQs, giving Nicola Sturgeon the toughest time she’s had in parliament in many a week.""[13]
Presiding Officer[edit]
On 13 May 2021, Johnstone stood unopposed in the election to appoint the 6th Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament.  A yes/no vote was held on her nomination, and she won with 97 Yes votes,[14] 29 No votes, two abstentions and one spoilt vote.[15]  The Presiding Officer is expected to be strictly nonpartisan, so Johnstone resigned her Greens membership to take on the role.[2][16]Johnstone is the second woman in the post. The first was Tricia Marwick, who was Presiding Officer from 2011 to 2016.[17] She is also the first Green MSP to serve as Presiding Officer. She is also the second Presiding Officer to be elected unopposed, after George Reid in 2003.[15]On 14 May 2021, SNP MSP Annabelle Ewing and Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur were elected as the two Deputy Presiding Officers.[18]  This is the first time since the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 that neither the Presiding Officer nor any of the deputies has been a Labour or Conservative MSP.[18]On 16 March 2022, Johnstone was appointed to the Privy Council by Her Majesty The Queen and therefore granted the title 'The Right Honourable'.[19] She said in response to her appointment: Johnstone said: “It was a great privilege to be elected Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament last May, and it was an honour to be made a Privy Counsellor by Her Majesty The Queen this afternoon. “This appointment is recognition of the important role the Scottish Parliament and the Office of Presiding Officer plays and I am pleased to accept it.”

Personal life[edit]
Johnstone has a husband and daughter.[20][5]

A councillor for 15 years prior to entering parliament, Alison McInnes was first elected to Gordon District Council in 1992. She went on to represent Ellon and District on Aberdeenshire Council between 1995 and 2007, becoming one of the most senior councillors in the region.

Personal detailsBorn (1954-08-05) 5 August 1954 (age 69)Political partyScottish LabourAllan Wilson (born 5 August 1954) is a former Scottish Labour Party politician. He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the  Cunninghame North constituency, a seat which he held from the inaugural Scottish Parliament general election in 1999 until his defeat at the 2007 election.
He was educated at Glengarnock Primary school and at Spier's school near Beith, Ayrshire, and worked as a trades union official with NUPE and UNISON until his election to the Scottish Parliament. He was a member of the Executive of the Scottish Labour Party from 1992 until 1999 and election agent for Brian Wilson.
He was Labour lead on the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee and also a member of the European Committee prior to becoming Deputy Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport in October 2000 and then Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development in November 2001 in the Scottish Executive. In October 2004 he was appointed Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.
He is married, has two sons, and lives in Kilbirnie. He was a member of the Scottish Parliamentary football team, current holders of the four nations' Parliamentary Trophy (Parliamentary Shield) and Chairman of Kilbirnie Community Football Club comprising 15 teams and for over thirty years a former player, coach and manager of various Ayrshire juvenile, amateur and junior teams in the Scottish Junior Football Association, Scottish Amateur Football Association and the Scottish Football Association.
In the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election he lost his seat Cunninghame North to the Scottish National Party's Kenny Gibson, by only 48 votes in an election with over a thousand spoilt ballot papers, making it the most marginal seat in the country. Wilson originally wished to challenge the result via a recount but the Scottish Labour Party, following advice from their solicitors, did not proceed with an election petition on his behalf.[1]
In the 2011 election, Wilson again stood against Gibson for the Cunninghame North seat, but this time lost more emphatically, with Gibson's majority increasing from 48 to 6,117.[2]

Personal detailsBorn (1983-03-14) 14 March 1983 (age 40)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyLabourSpouseFurheen Ashrif ​(m. 2006)​Children3RelativesMohammad Sarwar (father)Alma materUniversity of GlasgowSignatureWebsiteanassarwar.co.uk Anas Sarwar (born 14 March 1983) is a politician who has served as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party since 2021. He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region since 2016, having been Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Central from 2010 to 2015.
Born in Glasgow to Pakistani Muslim parents, Sarwar was privately educated at the independent Hutchesons' Grammar School and studied general dentistry at the University of Glasgow. He worked in Paisley as a dentist until being elected as Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central at the 2010 general election when he succeeded his retiring father, Mohammad Sarwar. During his time in the House of Commons, he served as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2011 to 2014.
Sarwar lost his seat to the Scottish National Party (SNP) at the 2015 general election. After leaving Westminster, he was elected at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election on the Glasgow regional list. Having been defeated in the 2017 Scottish Labour leadership election by Richard Leonard, he was elected as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in the 2021 leadership election. Sarwar led Scottish Labour into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, which saw Scottish Labour remain in opposition with two fewer Labour MSPs than at the previous election. He was defeated by incumbent First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Glasgow Southside but was returned on the Glasgow regional list.

Early life and career[edit]
Anas Sarwar was born on 14 March 1983 in Glasgow, the youngest of four children. His parents were Perveen Sarwar and Mohammad Sarwar, both Pakistani Muslims.[1][2][3] He attended Hutchesons' Grammar School, a private school in Glasgow, before completing a degree in general dentistry at the University of Glasgow from 2000 to 2005.[4] While a student, he joined marches against the Iraq War.[5] He worked as an NHS dentist in Paisley from 2005 until 2009.[4]
Early political career[edit]
Sarwar began campaigning for the Labour Party as a child of ""nine or ten"" and joined the party at the age of fifteen or sixteen.[3][4][5] His father was elected as the Labour MP for Glasgow Govan in 1997, becoming the UK's first Muslim MP.[6] In that year, Sarwar received an envelope containing a threat against his mother.[7] Sarwar served as an executive member of Scottish Young Labour and later joined the Co-operative Party, a party which stands candidates jointly with the Labour Party, as well as the Fabian Society, the trades unions Unite and Community, and the pressure group Progress.[8][9] He served as vice-chair of Progress in 2011.[8]Sarwar was selected as the lead regional list candidate for the Glasgow Scottish Parliament electoral region for the 2007 election.[6] He was a member of Labour's Scottish Policy Forum which was responsible for drawing-up the Scottish Labour Party manifesto for that election. He was not elected, later saying that standing as a list candidate had been a chance ""to prove himself"", and that he had had ""no chance"" of success given his party's success in winning constituency seats under the additional member system.[3][10]
Member of Parliament[edit]
Margaret Curran, Anas Sarwar, Johann Lamont and Gordon Brown at the launch of United with Labour Sarwar's father announced his retirement as the MP for Glasgow Central in February 2007.[11] Later that year, Sarwar was selected as the Labour candidate for the seat at the 2010 United Kingdom general election. Despite Labour's loss of power at that general election, Anas Sarwar emphasised his independence and differentiated himself from his father's politics. The Guardian described him as positioning himself on the ""moderate left"" of the Labour Party, supporting electoral reform for the House of Commons, reforming the House of Lords to have a majority of elected seats but with some seats remaining appointed, and reducing the scale of the UK's nuclear deterrant. He opposed privatisation of the NHS but supported the use of private finance initiative schemes to build schools.[3] He won the election with 52.0% of the vote, an increase on the previous vote share and majority.[12][13][14]He was elected by colleagues to serve on the International Development Select Committee. He said that his parliamentary interests included foreign policy and international development, and that he wanted to ""use his parliamentary platform to make a difference on"" conflicts in Palestine and Kashmir.[15] In December 2011, Sarwar was elected as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party receiving 51.1% of the vote.[16] In January 2013, he was awarded the Politician of The Year Award at the British Muslim Awards.[17] In 2013, Sarwar took a strong line in attacking both the ""bedroom tax"" and accused the Scottish Government of failure to mitigate its worst effects. During a vote on its repeal, Sarwar was overseas in Pakistan, giving a speech to students at Hajvery University, and so was paired with a Conservative MP, cancelling out the two votes. He was criticised for his absence by the Scottish National Party.[18][19] In 2014, Sarwar was criticised by SNP politicians for sending his son to Hutchesons' Grammar School, a private school and the same school that he himself attended, instead of a state school.[20]From November 2014 until May 2015, Sarwar served as Shadow Minister for International Development.[21] In January 2015, he was awarded the Spirit of Britain Award at that year's British Muslim Awards.[22]In 2012, he was appointed to co-ordinate Scottish Labour's 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign.[23] The campaign, alongside Better Together, was successful, with 55% of the electorate of Scotland voting to stay in the United Kingdom. The Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Johann Lamont, resigned from the position on 25 October 2014, criticising the attitude of the Labour Party as a whole to the Scottish Labour Party and saying that Scottish Labour needed to be more autonomous. The Guardian reported that she felt like she needed to resign after the general secretary of Scottish Labour, Ian Price, was ""removed from office without her being consulted"".[24] Several Scottish Labour figures echoed her frustrations. Sarwar defended the UK-wide Labour Party, and said that Price ""resigned from his position as general secretary and I think we should respect his position"".[24] Following the resignation of Johann Lamont on 25 October 2014, Sarwar became acting leader until the new leader, Jim Murphy, was elected. On 30 October, he announced his resignation as deputy leader. At the 2015 general election, Sarwar lost his seat to Alison Thewliss of the SNP. Following that election, in what was a historic defeat for Labour, they were left with a single seat (Edinburgh South) after half a century of political domination of Scottish seats at Westminster.[25]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Sarwar was elected as an additional member in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election for the Glasgow region. In 2016, he was appointed as Scottish Labour's spokesperson for health and sport. Sarwar was opposed to leaving the European Union and said that the UK needed to stay in the single market in order to counter the Conservatives' austerity policies.[26] However, on BBC Radio 4 in April 2023 Sarwar, while expressing hope that Labour would do well in 2024 in the wake of the SNP's troubles, ruled out any plan to rejoin the EU, or to join its single market, or to join its customs union.[27]  He sought advice from the police after creating a working group on Islamophobia.[5]
Sarwar in 2017In September 2017, he announced he would run for the Scottish Labour leadership following the resignation of Kezia Dugdale.[28] He was characterised by opponents as being on the right of the Labour Party and a Blairite, which he repudiated, describing himself as a Brownite.[29] He called the Iraq War ""the worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime"".[30] He expressed support for UK-wide Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's policies of ""a £10 national living wage, public ownership of the railways, higher taxation for the rich and tougher laws on basic wages and employment rights"".[29] He proposed a tax rate of 50p for earnings over £100,000 and cuts to income tax for earnings under £28,000, including a new 15p tax rate for lower earners.[31] His campaign emphasised equality over discussions of independence.[5] He defended sending his children to a private school, saying he and his wife had done what they ""thought was best for [their] children"".[29] Sarwar was criticised by opponents after it emerged that his family firm was advertising job vacancies with pay below the recommended living wage.[32][33] His opponent in the election, Richard Leonard, was on the left wing of the Labour Party. Leonard won the election with 56.7% of the vote. During the 2017 leadership election, Rutherglen councillor Davie McLachlan allegedly said ""Scotland wouldn't vote for a brown Muslim Paki"". In April 2019, Sarwar's case against McLachlan was due to be heard by the National Constitutional Committee but was dropped on a technicality, as Sarwar had not given his case within the required timescale. Leonard acknowledged the process was flawed and the committee would need to be reformed to avoid similar incidents.[34]Sarwar was replaced as health and sport spokesperson by Monica Lennon in October 2018.[35] He said he had only learnt of the sacking on the social media platform Twitter.[36] In November 2019, Sarwar was given access to a leaked report from 2015 which had considered infection controls at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital to be at ""high risk"". 10-year-old patient Milly Main died in the hospital in 2017 from a water infection, while she was there to recover from leukaemia. Sarwar raised the leaked report's findings in a Scottish Parliament debate in which he criticised NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for not closing certain hospital wards despite the report's findings. He requested on behalf of Main's mother, a constituent of his, a response from the first minister Nicola Sturgeon.[37] In November 2020, Sarwar was appointed as Scottish Labour's spokesperson for the constitution.[38]
Leader of the Scottish Labour Party[edit]
Following the resignation of Richard Leonard in 2021, Sarwar was elected as leader of the Scottish Labour Party, winning 57.6% of the vote to Monica Lennon's 42.4%.[39]The Guardian described him as a centrist.[40] Despite having criticised Corbyn in the past, Sarwar insisted that his economic plans would be ""even more progressive and radical"" than those of Corbyn and the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell.[41] Sarwar and some reporters said this made him the first ethnic minority person to lead a major UK political party, although The Spectator pointed to political leaders of Jewish descent such as Benjamin Disraeli, Michael Howard and Ed Miliband whilst acknowledging he was the first Muslim and person of Asian descent.[42][43] The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross, proposed a coalition of parties supporting Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom, which Sarwar rejected.[5] Sarwar called the United Kingdom ""fundamentally broken"", and said that there should be more devolution of power from Westminster to Holyrood, and from Holyrood to communities. He also confirmed Scottish Labour's opposition to renewing the Trident nuclear programme.[44]As the leader of Scottish Labour in the run-up to the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Sarwar pledged to reduce poverty and inequality in Scotland as part of his policy solutions to the aftermath of COVID-19 crisis.[45] In the run-up to the election, the Labour Party removed Hollie Cameron, a Labour candidate who said in an interview that Labour would support a second referendum on Scottish independence depending on timing, contrary to the party's policy. Sarwar was criticised for the decision by figures on the left of the Labour Party.[46]Sarwar himself ran as both a list candidate and as constituency candidate for Glasgow Southside, which the first minister Nicola Sturgeon represented. The election saw the worst result for Scottish Labour since devolution, with two fewer Labour MSPs returned than at the previous election.[47] Although he was defeated by the incumbent first minister Nicola Sturgeon in Glasgow Southside, he was re-elected as a list MSP.[48]In January 2022, it was reported that the UK-wide Labour leader Keir Starmer was interested in allowing more supporters of independence to stand as Labour candidates. Sarwar said that candidates would need to stand on a platform of Scotland remaining in the UK, and that ""when it comes to Scottish Labour, I’m in charge"".[49] In March 2022, Sarwar announced a policy of providing free residential care and free home care, alongside increasing care workers' wages to a minimum of £15 an hour.[50] Sarwar supports replacing the House of Lords with an elected senate that would represent nations and regions.[51] In November 2022, Declassified UK said that Sarwar was a member of the lobbying group British-American Project.[52][unreliable source?] In the same month, in an interview with The Times, he talked about the need for growth in order to deliver policies that improve equality and reduce poverty.[53]
Personal life[edit]
Sarwar is married to Furheen Sarwar, who works as an NHS dentist. The couple has three young children.[54][55] He is a Muslim Punjabi Arain.[56] He owns a quarter share of his family's cash-and-carry wholesale business; his share was valued in 2016 as worth between £2.7 million and £4.8 million.[57] In September 2017, Sarwar transferred his shareholding to a discretionary trust for the benefit of his three children, so that he could not personally access the assets or dividends.[55]He is the president of the Sarwar Foundation, and is teetotal.[58][59]

Personal detailsBorn1970 (age 53–54)Lanark, South Lanarkshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyChildren3ResidenceEdinburghAlma materUniversity of StrathclydeUniversity of St. AndrewsOccupationEconomist, CommunicationsWebsitewww.charlottestpartners.co.ukAndrew Wilson (born 1970 in Lanark, Scotland) is an economist, businessman and former Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP). He is a founding partner at strategic communications firm Charlotte Street Partners. He chaired the Sustainable Growth Commission, which gave its completed report to First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, in 2018.

Early life[edit]
Whilst attending the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, (from where he graduated in 1992 with a degree in economics and politics) Wilson was elected Vice President of the Students Association and became National Convener of the Scottish National Party (SNP) student organisation, the Federation of Student Nationalists. He joined the Government Economic Service after graduation, serving with the Forestry Commission and Scottish Office, and in 1996 he started work at SNP Headquarters, Edinburgh, as a researcher to the Director of Business for Scotland, before entering employment with the Royal Bank of Scotland as a business economist in 1997.

Member of Scottish Parliament[edit]
Wilson was elected to the first session of the newly re-established Scottish Parliament,  as one of five SNP MSPs to represent Central Scotland through the Additional Members System.[1]Whilst an MSP he served variously in the Shadow Cabinet as the SNP Finance, Economy, Lifelong Learning and Transport Spokesperson. He was widely viewed by commentators as a rising star of the SNP, an iconoclast and pro-market economist he made much headway selling the idea of fiscal autonomy now called 'Devo-Max' to the mainstream business, media and society. It was adopted by The Scotsman, a unionist newspaper and later went on to win support across the political spectrum. He gave a controversial lecture at the party conference in 1999 promoting the idea Britishness could, should, and would survive independence. He later wrote a column for the Sunday Mail calling on Scots to support the English football team in the 2002 world cup finals. In policy he is credited with much of the work on the SNP's alternative to the private finance initiative, now The Scottish Futures Trust. He also promoted the case for a Scottish Sovereign wealth fund using the proceeds of North Sea Oil.
In 2003 he came within 520 votes of unseating Cathie Craigie in the first past the post contest for the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth seat, but when only three SNP MSPs were returned from Central Scotland he lost his place as an MSP.

After parliament[edit]
Following political service Wilson joined RBS Group working in a variety of roles including Deputy Chief Economist and since the 2008 crisis as Head of Group Communications.[2] He joined WPP in August 2012 working in a client facing role.[3]He delivered the Donaldson Lecture at the 2013 SNP conference.[4]In 2014 he launched a new strategic communications consultancy Charlotte Street Partners based in Edinburgh and London.[5] Along with co-founder Malcolm Robertson, he topped a list of ""names to watch"" published by The Scotsman in 2014.[6] He left Charlotte Street Partners in February 2023 before joining the Executive Committee of Santander UK plc as Director of Communications and Responsible Banking in March 2023.
He was a Trustee of the John Smith Memorial Trust[7] and is a Trustee of The John Smith Centre for Public Service at the University of Glasgow.[8] He is a former member of the Governing Board of the Scottish Crop Research Institute and between 2010 – 2015 he was a Director of Motherwell F.C.[9][10] He is a member of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the David Hume Institute.[5]He is a former columnist for the Scotland on Sunday and writes occasional opinion pieces for other newspapers including The Scotsman, The Times, The Daily Telegraph, the Daily Record and The National.
In September 2016, he was appointed to chair the Sustainable Growth Commission reporting to the First Minister of Scotland.[11] In October 2017, he was also appointed to the Independent Commission on Referendums at University College London's Constitution Unit.[12]In March 2020, he was re-appointed to the governing board of Motherwell F.C. as a Director.[13] He also currently serves as a trustee for National Galleries Scotland, the Edinburgh International Culture Summit Foundation, and Sistema Scotland, a social transformation charity engaging children through orchestral music.

Personal life[edit]
Wilson lives in Perthshire and in Edinburgh with his wife Mhairi Wilson (previously Clarke nee Dow) who he married in Florence in July 2022. He has three children and a stepson.

Personal detailsBorn (1962-03-17) 17 March 1962 (age 61)East Kilbride, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourAlma materGlasgow Caledonian UniversityAndy Kerr (born 17 March 1962) is a Scottish politician who served as Minister for Finance and Public Services from 2001 to 2004 and Minister for Health and Community Care from 2004 to 2007. A member of the Scottish Labour Party, he was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the East Kilbride constituency from 1999 to 2011.

Early years[edit]
Born in East Kilbride, Kerr was educated at Claremont High School in East Kilbride and obtained a BA in Social Sciences at Glasgow Caledonian University. Prior to being elected to the Scottish Parliament, he was a senior officer in Glasgow City Council land services department and served as an adviser in the Leader's office. He was also founder and managing director of Achieving, a quality assurance consultancy.

Parliamentary career[edit]
He was convener of the Scottish Parliament's Transport and Environment Committee and served on the Confederation of British Industry working group designed to bring Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) and business closer together as well as being on the cross-party group on ageing and the elderly.
Kerr is considered to be an ally of Motherwell and Wishaw MSP Jack McConnell, working with him on his two successive bids for the leadership of Scottish Labour and the position of First Minister.
Kerr was first appointed Minister for Finance and Public Services in the Scottish Executive in November 2001 and moved to become Minister for Health and Community Care in October 2004, replacing Malcolm Chisolm. As Health Minister, Kerr oversaw significant NHS restructuring.
He was also responsible for the Scottish ban on smoking ban in public places which was introduced on 26 March 2006. In November 2006, he won the Scottish Politician of the Year award in recognition of his work to bring in the smoking ban.[1] Kerr retained the health portfolio in McConnell's shadow cabinet upon the Scottish National Party's victory at the 2007 election.[2]Having ruled himself out of contention as a successor for Jack McConnell, Kerr voted for Wendy Alexander to become leader of the Scottish Labour Party. On 17 September 2007 he was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Public Services and Local Government. With Wendy Alexander's resignation as leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, Kerr stood for election as the next leader. However, following the victory of Iain Gray in the leadership election, Kerr was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth.
At the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Kerr was one of many Labour casualties, losing his seat after 12 years to Linda Fabiani of the SNP.[3] Kerr did not stand on the regional list, so therefore did not return as an MSP.

After Politics[edit]
On 11 July 2011, it was announced that Andy had been appointed to the vacant CEO position at Scottish Charity Organisation, Sense Scotland.[4]In April 2019, Andy Kerr was appointed Chief Operating Officer at the newly formed Piper Group of charities, partnering Sense Scotland with Enable Scotland.[5] Five Months later, Sense Scotland would quit the partnership, however, Andy Kerr remained in post at The Piper Group.[6]In November 2019, he was appointed to the Board of the Scottish Funding Council,[7] and in 2020, Andy Kerr was appointed Chair of the Scottish Government's Fair Work in Social Care Group.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Kerr lives in Strathaven with his wife and he has 3 daughters.

He was elected as a member of the Scottish Greens, but resigned from the party in 2020 and served out the rest of his term as an independent. He is also a writer and researcher best known for his work on land ownership in Scotland. He is the author of Who Owns Scotland (1996) and The Poor Had No Lawyers (2015).

Background[edit]
Wightman was born in Dundee. He graduated from the University of Aberdeen in 1985 with a degree in forestry.[1][2] He was a co-founder of Reforesting Scotland, an environmental charity dedicated to substantial reforestation and the promotion of a sustainable forest culture.[3]He began his career as a scientist working on renewable energy at the University of Aberdeen and then as a Projects Officer with Central Scotland Countryside Trust. He was appointed as the first development officer of Reforesting Scotland in 1991.  He became a self-employed writer and researcher in 1993. Over the next 20 years, he contributed to a wide range of debates on land use, land reform, the Crown estate, common good land, local democracy and fiscal reform. Author of a number of reports on these topics, he also served as a Specialist Adviser to the UK Parliament's Scottish Affairs Committee Inquiry on land reform 2014–2015.[citation needed]He appeared in the documentary You've Been Trumped (2011), which dealt with Donald Trump's controversial golf course development at Balmedie, Aberdeenshire where he advised Michael Forbes on his land dispute with Trump,[4][unreliable source?] as well as the 2016 sequel You've Been Trumped Too.[5]He was coordinator of the Land Action Scotland campaign. The campaign has the stated aim of supporting local residents through seeking to democratise companies that are run by a handful of people who are not living on the land involved.[6][7]In February 2015, Wightman was announced as being a member of the Commission on Local Tax Reform.[8] This cross-party group was set up by the Scottish Government, tasked with examining alternatives to the Council Tax. The final report Just Change: A New Approach to Local Taxation was published on 14 December 2015.

Political career[edit]
Wightman became a member of the Scottish Greens in 2009.[9] In March 2015, the Scottish Greens balloted their members to select candidates for the 2016 election, and Wightman was placed second on their Lothian list.[10] He was elected as an MSP on 5 May 2016.[11] On 23 May he was announced as the Scottish Greens spokesperson on Communities (including Housing), Land Reform and Local Government.[12]Wightman was one of a group of Scottish politicians (two MSPs, an MP and three MEPs) who instituted proceedings against HM Government to clarify, through a judgment of the European Court of Justice, whether the Article 50 notice that formally started the Brexit process could be revoked unilaterally by the United Kingdom.[13][14] In December 2018, the ECJ handed down its Wightman judgment in which it held that the Brexit notification could indeed be revoked unilaterally.[15][16]On 18 December 2020, Wightman announced his resignation from the Scottish Greens following a vote on an amendment to the Forensic Medical Services (Victims of Sexual Offences) (Scotland) Bill,[17] alleging that the party was intolerant to discussion of potential clashes between transgender and women's rights. He stated in his resignation letter that voting for the amendment (and against the party whip) would have resulted in ""complaints and disciplinary action leading to possible suspension, deselection or expulsion"".[18][19][20] The Scottish Greens' co-leader Lorna Slater later dismissed the impact of Wightman's resignation, saying in an interview to The Scotsman that although his departure had come as a ""massive shock"", it wasn't a big issue: ""[Wightman] has very specific followers, but most people have no idea who he is."" She also said that Wightman had not engaged with women's and LGBT groups within the Scottish Greens before his departure.[21]In August 2021, Wightman explained in his blog that he resigned from the Greens because he wanted ""an environment that is more tolerant, questioning, critical, empathetic and more willing to listen"".[22][20]Wightman later stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate for the Highlands and Islands region in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[23]In November 2022, Wightman announced that he would not support a second Scottish independence referendum ""until there is sustained support for it"".[24]

A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Almond Valley since 2007.
Born in West Lothian, Constance studied at the University of Glasgow and University of Stirling, before working as a social worker in the Lothians. She served as a councillor for West Lothian Council, where she was a spokesperson for children's services and lifelong learning. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Constance was elected as a member of the Scottish Parliament for the Livingston constituency. As an SNP backbencher she served as a member of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit and justice committee. 
Constance was appointed to the Scottish Government in 2010 and served under First Minister Alex Salmond as the minister for skills and lifelong learning and the following year she was reshuffled as the minister for children and young people. She later served as the youth employment minister, before the portfolio was expanded and promoted to cabinet-level in 2014 as the Cabinet Secretary for Training, Youth and Women's Employment. Following the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon as depute leader of the SNP when she announced her candidacy for leader, Constance ran unsuccessfully in the 2014 depute leadership contest, losing to Stewart Hosie.  
Sturgeon was successful in her bid for leader and was subsequently sworn in as first minister and appointed Constance as education secretary. In a cabinet reshuffle in 2016, she was appointed the equalities secretary and oversaw the introduction of social security powers in Scotland. Constance left government in 2018 to sit as a backbencher. In 2020, Sturgeon appointed her to the new portfolio of drugs policy minister after record high drug deaths in Scotland. On 29 March 2023, newly appointed First Minister Humza Yousaf re-appointed Constance to cabinet as the justice secretary.

Early life[edit]
Angela Constance was born on 15 July 1970 in Blackburn, West Lothian,[1] the daughter of Simon Constance,[2] a coalminer, and Mary Baird Constance (née Colquhoun).[3][4] She was educated at West Calder High School and later Bo’ness Academy.[5]Constance attended the University of Glasgow, where she gained an MA in Social Science. At Glasgow University, she served on the Students' Representative Council, becoming president of the council in 1991.[6][7]Alastair Allan was her sabbatical vice president. She earned a Certificate of Welfare Studies from West Lothian College and an MSc in Social Work from the University of Stirling.[7]Before her election to Holyrood, Constance worked as a social worker and was a Councillor for West Lothian Council where she was the SNP spokesperson for children's services and lifelong learning. She also stood for the SNP in the 2005 Livingston by-election, finishing second behind Scottish Labour with 32.7% of the vote.[8]
Political career[edit]
Training, Youth and Women's employment[edit]
During the 2014 SNP spring conference, First Minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond promoted Constance to the Scottish Cabinet in the position of Cabinet Secretary for Training, Youth and Women’s Employment. In the position, Constance was somewhat criticised by the opposition Scottish Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament, claiming that since Constance, youth unemployment in Scotland had actually risen.[9] In response to this, Constance stated:

These figures, based on data for 2013, show that the employment prospects are improving across much of Scotland, with women’s employment driving much of this improvement. “They also show that Scotland continues to outperformed the UK across all headline labour market indicators, with a lower unemployment rate, higher employment rate and lower economic inactivity rate.[9]
Previously, Constance was a junior Scottish cabinet member.[10]
SNP Depute leadership bid, 2014[edit]
Further information: Scottish National Party leadership election, 2014
Following defeat in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Scottish National Party leader and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond announced his resignation as SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland.[11] In the aftermath of his resignation, a leadership bid was launched, and the then Deputy First Minister of Scotland and SNP Depute leader Nicola Sturgeon was widely tipped to become Salmond's successor.[12][13]On 30 September 2014, Constance officially launched her bid to become the Depute leader of the Scottish National Party,[14][15] competing against Stewart Hosie and Keith Brown.[16] It was later revealed by Constance that she was ""not seeking the position of Deputy First Minister"".[17]The results of the election were announced at the SNP Autumn Conference on 14 November, with Constance losing the contest to Stewart Hosie, after being eliminated in the first round.[18]
Cabinet Secretary for Education[edit]
Following the election of Nicola Sturgeon as the First Minister, in November 2014, Constance was promoted as the Cabinet Secretary for Education within the Scottish Cabinet.

Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities[edit]
After the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Nicola Sturgeon reshuffled her Cabinet. On 18 May, Constance was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities.

Minister for Drugs Policy[edit]
In December 2020 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sacked Joe FitzPatrick as Public Health Minister after official figures revealed that 1,264 people in Scotland had died from drugs in 2019. The number of deaths was three and a half times higher the figure for England and Wales and by some margin the highest in Europe.[19] Sturgeon described the SNP's record on drugs as ""indefensible""[20] and Constance was given a full time ministerial portfolio with responsibility for the crisis.[19] The appointment was not universally welcomed; journalist Alex Massie opined in The Times that: ""It says something, mind you, about the depth of talent available to Sturgeon that... she felt compelled to hand the drugs brief to Angela Constance, a minister she had previously demoted. Twice.""[21]At the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May 2021, Constance was re-elected as MSP for Almond Valley. On 19 May 2021, she was re-appointed to the new government, retaining the post of Minister for Drugs Policy.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Constance has been married to Garry Knox since 2000.[23] After her election to Holyrood, Constance announced she was expecting her first child in October 2007.

Personal detailsBorn (1964-09-10) 10 September 1964 (age 59)Edinburgh, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Labour PartyAngus MacKay (born 10 September 1964) is a Scottish politician who served as Minister for Finance and Local Government from 2000 to 2001. A member of the Scottish Labour Party, he was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Edinburgh South constituency from 1999 to 2003.[1]Born in Edinburgh, MacKay graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a MA in Politics and Modern History. Before entering politics, he worked for Shelter Scotland and served as parliamentary researchers to Adam Ingram and Mo Mowlam, and was political adviser to Henry McLeish. In the 1995 Scottish local election, MacKay was elected to the City of Edinburgh council, and was later appointed Convenor of Finance in the council's committee in 1997. He stood down as a councillor following his election to the Scottish Parliament in the 1999 election.
Donald Dewar appointed MacKay Deputy Minister for Justice under Dewar's administration. Deputising for Jim Wallace, MacKay had particular responsibility for land reform and coordination of the Scottish Executive's drugs policy. Calls for his resignation were made after he claimed  the sex offenders register in Scotland was a matter reserved for Westminster. In May 2000, he revealed the Scottish Executive's ten year plan to tackle the drug crisis in Scotland, with an aim to younger drug takers as a young as 11. Following the death of Dewar, McLeish was appointed First Minister and he appointed MacKay to cabinet as Minister for Finance and Local Government.

Early life[edit]
Education[edit]
Angus MacKay was born on 10 September 1964 in Edinburgh.[2] He was educated at St Augustine's High School, before attending the University of Edinburgh where he earned an MA (Hons) in Politics and Modern History.[3]
Early career[edit]
MacKay worked for Shelter Scotland from 1987 to 1990. In 1990, he became a parliamentary researcher for Adam Ingram, the MP for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, and Mo Mowlam, the MP for Redcar. He was then political adviser to Henry McLeish from 1992 to 1995 and then Press Co-ordinator to George Robertson during the 1997 UK General Election.[4]
Political career[edit]
Early political years[edit]
MacKay was elected to the City of Edinburgh Council in 1995 and was appointed Convener of Finance in 1997. As Finance Convenor, he had responsibilities for shaping and delivering Edinburgh's annual budget and reviewing expenditure, service delivery and service reform.[5] In 1999, he stood down from local government following his election to the Scottish Parliament.

Deputy Minister for Justice; 1999–2000[edit]
MacKay in 2000In the first election to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, MacKay was elected to the Edinburgh South constituency.[3]Scottish Labour secured a coalition agreement with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, putting Donald Dewar in the office of First Minister. Dewar appointed MacKay as the Deputy Minister for Justice in his administration. He was deputising for Minister for Justice Jim Wallace and had particular responsibility for land reform and coordination of the Scottish Executive's drugs policy.[6]In July 2000, calls for MacKay to resign by opposition parties were made after he wrongly claimed the sex offenders register in Scotland was a matter reserved for Westminster. He later admitted it was a devolved issue for which the Executive was responsible for. Lyndsay McIntosh, the Scottish Conservative's deputy home affairs spokeswoman, called for his resignation, stating: ""I think Mr MacKay has to consider his position... If he doesn't know the scope of the job and doesn't know his responsibilities then perhaps someone else should be doing the job"". MacKay rejected calls for his resignation and focused on plans to introduce tougher guidelines on the monitoring of sex offenders. He said that from there would be a better system of information-sharing for police, councils and social workers and ""the guidance will include advice on how these bodies can carry out risk assessments, not just of offenders on the register, but on other individuals with a previous conviction for a sex offence, or individuals suspected of such activities, who are giving cause for concern"".[7]As Deputy Minister for Justice, MacKay also had responsibility for drug policy. Following a trip from New York, United States, in May 2000, he unveiled the Scottish Executive's ten year plan to tackle the drug crisis in Scotland. Despite the launch of his new anti-drug campaign, the Executive failed to increase spending on tackling drugs. MacKay revealed the campaign would aim to young drug takers as young as eleven. ""What we have to remember is that drugs and the drugs dealers are a very organised lot and they go out to recruit new customers at a very young age,"" he stated. MacKay added that the Executive was working hard to produce legislation allowing the assets of known drug dealers to be seized, but new legislation would have to be in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.[8]
Minister for Finance; 2000–2001[edit]
Following the death of Donald Dewar in 2000, MacKay served as campaign manager for Henry McLeish in his bid for the leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland and First Minister. McLeish's campaign was successful, defeating Jack McConnell in the contest. He formed his administration and appointed MacKay as the Minister for Finance and Local Government, replacing McConnell.[3]When McLeish resigned in 2001, McConnell was elected as his replacement unopposed. In McConnell's first cabinet reshuffle, MacKay was sacked from Cabinet.[9]
Out of government[edit]
In the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, MacKay was not re-elected after being defeated by the Liberal Democrat candidate Mike Pringle.[10]
Post-political career[edit]
In 2003, MacKay, with Gail Hannah, founded
MacKay Hannah Ltd in Edinburgh ""to Influence policy making, Inform policy development, Connect with decision makers and build Networks.""[11][12]

Children2Alma materUniversity of AberdeenSignatureWebsiteOfficial websiteAngus Struan Carolus Robertson (born 28 September 1969) is a Scottish politician serving as the Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture since 2021. Former Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2016 to 2018, he has served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Edinburgh Central since 2021. Robertson previously served as a Westminster MP for Moray from 2001 to 2017, where he served from 2007 to 2017 as the Leader of the SNP in the House of Commons.
A graduate of the University of Aberdeen, Robertson previously worked as a journalist. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 2001. In 2017, he sought re-election as the MP for Moray and lost to the Scottish Conservative candidate, Douglas Ross.[1] He was succeeded as SNP Westminster Leader by Ian Blackford.
Robertson resigned as SNP Depute Leader in February 2018, before launching the pro-independence think tank Progress Scotland in 2019, alongside Mark Diffley.[2] In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Robertson was elected to the Scottish Parliament for Edinburgh Central.

Early life and career[edit]
Robertson was born in Wimbledon, London, to a Scottish father, Struan, who was an engineer, and a German mother, Anna, who was a nurse. Robertson was brought up in Edinburgh and speaks fluent German. He was educated at Broughton High School, Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen, where he graduated in 1991 with an MA Honours degree in politics and international relations.  After university he embarked on a journalistic career, and worked as a foreign and diplomatic correspondent in Central Europe for the BBC World Service.
Robertson joined the Scottish National Party in 1984, at the age of 15, after being given a leaflet about the party's youth wing by Charlie Reid of The Proclaimers. He was the European and International Affairs Adviser to the SNP Group in the Scottish Parliament.

Political career[edit]
House of Commons[edit]
Robertson was first elected to the UK House of Commons in June 2001, representing the Moray constituency. During his first parliamentary session, Robertson was Scotland's youngest MP and was rated Scotland's ""hardest working MP"" according to statistics from the House of Commons.[3] He was a member of the European Scrutiny Committee from 2001 to 2010, and served as the SNP's spokesman on Defence and International Relations. Robertson was well above average amongst MPs in the number of contributions he made in the House of Commons.[4] In January 2006, Robertson provided Swiss Senator Dick Marty a report containing what he calls 'a detailed report of numerous suspect movements of aircraft transiting through Scotland.[5]
Leader of the SNP in the House of Commons[edit]
Robertson's official parliamentary portrait, 2001In May 2007, he became SNP Leader in the House of Commons, following Alex Salmond's election as First Minister of Scotland.[6] Following the 2015 general election and the election of Salmond as MP for Gordon, it was confirmed that he would continue in his role as leader in the Commons. In September 2015, he was appointed to the Privy Council and as a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament.[7][8]In 2007 Robertson pushed for a UK-wide referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, something that the SNP opposed because it entrenched EU control over Scottish affairs.  ""We'll trust the people, while Gordon Brown will not trust the people,"" Robertson told The Daily Record, ""We are honour-bound to support a referendum.""[9]Ahead of the 2015 General Election, Robertson had the SNP pass a code of conduct that stated any MP must, ""accept that no member shall within or outwith the parliament publicly criticise a group decision, policy or another member of the group"".[10] Rival parties labelled it a ""Stalinist"" crackdown on free speech and independent thought.[11]In 2018 it was revealed that Robertson had been contacted a decade ago by staff at Edinburgh Airport about the alleged behaviour of then First Minister Alex Salmond. Robertson said: ""In 2009 I was called by an Edinburgh Airport manager about Alex Salmond's perceived 'inappropriateness' towards female staff at the airport. I was asked if I could informally broach the subject with Mr Salmond to make him aware of this perception. I raised the matter directly with Mr Salmond, who denied he had acted inappropriately in any way. I communicated back to the Edinburgh Airport manager that a conversation had happened. The matter being resolved, and without a formal complaint having been made, it was not reported further.""[12] It was subsequently reported that Salmond had been banned from using a VIP access corridor at the airport.[13] Robertson's handling of the allegations were later investigated by the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints in 2020 and he submitted written evidence.[14]In January 2016, Robertson said that British Prime Minister David Cameron should admit to British involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen: ""Isn't it time for the Prime Minister to admit that Britain is effectively taking part in a war in Yemen that is costing thousands of civilians lives and he has not sought parliamentary approval to do this?""[15]
Depute Leader of the SNP[edit]
Robertson in 2016On 13 October 2016, he was elected Depute Leader of the SNP, replacing Stewart Hosie. Robertson received 52.5% of the votes, defeating Tommy Sheppard (25.5%), Alyn Smith (18.6%) and Chris McEleny (3.3%) in the election.[1] He resigned in February 2018.[16]During the 2017 general election Robertson told the media that ""Tory is a four letter word in Scotland"", but amid a backlash to Nicola Sturgeon's decision to call for a second independence referendum,[17] he lost his Moray seat to Douglas Ross of the Scottish Conservatives.[18] In a profile of the seat for The Guardian after the election, journalist Severin Carrell summarised the result: ""Moray had been an SNP seat for 30 years but... using Brexit as the basis for a second independence vote so soon after 2014 crystallised an irritation with the party brewing for several years. The Tory cry that Sturgeon needed “to get on with the day job” resonated.""[19]After losing his seat, Robertson resigned as a Depute Leader of the SNP and established Progress Scotland, a pro-independence think-tank.[18]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
In February 2020, Robertson announced his intention to contest the Edinburgh Central constituency in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[18] He won selection ahead of Marco Biagi, a former MSP for the area.[20] Robertson won the seat with 39% of the vote, beating out the Scottish Conservative candidate by 4,732 votes.[21]
Constitution Secretary[edit]
In May 2021, following the SNP's victory, he was appointed Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.[22] Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Scottish Liberal Democrats said his party could not support the role, filled by Robertson. He stated ""not one minute"" of ministerial or civil service time should given to the ""tired, old arguments about currency and about borders"". However, his amendment to a Scottish Government motion appointing new ministers was rejected by 70 votes to four, with 51 abstentions.[23]In 2022 Robertson was charged with overseeing Scotland's decennial census. However, when only 77% of households returned the census - compared with a rate of 97% for the one in England and Wales the previous year - Robertson extended the deadline at a cost of nearly £10 million.[24] Robertson said the war in Ukraine was partly to blame but told the Scottish Parliament there were ""potentially serious consequences for not completing a census"".[25][26] Opposition politicians labelled Robertson's handling of the census ""nothing short of disastrous"" and said the SNP had been foolish not to hold it at the same time as the rest of the country when there was a significant amount of UK-wide publicity about the event.[27]
Controversies[edit]
In September 2014, Robertson – and three of his SNP colleagues – were criticised by The Scotsman and Labour MPs after they missed a vote on an amendment to the bedroom tax that would have exempted certain people in certain circumstances - with critics making the point that the SNP had made opposition to the bedroom tax a central part of its campaign for a yes vote in that year's independence referendum. The Labour's Johann Lamont said: ""Far from standing up for Scotland, the SNP have stayed at home and let Scotland down."" The SNP's Philippa Whitford responded: ""This vote demonstrates exactly why we need independence. This was a defeat for the UK government but it doesn’t end the bedroom tax.""[28][29] In December 2014 Robertson did turn up to division on the issue and voted for a Labour motion to scrap it.[30] Although Andrew George's Affordable Homes Bill passed at the vote thanks to Labour and Liberal Democrat votes, it did not progress to become law as the Conservative government did not supply a Money Resolution required for the next stage of the process.[31][32]Ahead of the selection contest for the seat of Edinburgh Central, the SNP National Executive Committee announced that any MP chosen as a candidate for Holyrood would be obliged to resign from Westminster ahead of the election to the Scottish Parliament.[33] Some considered the rule change a deliberate ""stitch up"" by the SNP establishment to stop MP Joanna Cherry, a critic of the party leadership, from winning the party's nomination for the seat and boost the candidacy of Angus Robertson, a leadership loyalist.[34] Cherry dropped out of the contest, citing an unwillingness to make her staff unemployed in a pandemic, and Robertson won the party's nomination.[35]In September 2020, Robertson wrote that a rise in support for independence in opinion polls could be attributed to, ""55,000 predominantly No supporting older voters passing away every year... Since 2014, this has added around 330,000 voters to the electorate, with a likely net gain of over 100,000 for independence.”[36] His remarks were condemned as tasteless by opposition parties and his successor as MP for Moray, Douglas Ross, described them as, ""Disgraceful and deeply disappointing comments from Angus Robertson, suggesting that the most vulnerable age group, who have been hardest hit through the tragic loss of so many lives throughout the pandemic, are a boost to his independence obsession. A new low for the SNP.” Robertson said his analysis was ""simple statistical facts"".[37]
Expenses claims[edit]
In 2015, The Daily Telegraph reported that Robertson's second home expenses had included a television costing £1,119, a £400 home cinema system, £500 for a bed, £20 for a corkscrew and £2,324 for a sofa bed.[38] The home cinema system was initially denied by the expenses office; however, Robertson appealed this decision and it was subsequently awarded.
In 2017 it was reported in several newspapers that Robertson had sold his second home in London, the mortgage on which was paid on expenses, as part of his divorce settlement. Robertson had previously pledged to repay the value of the expenses on the property and donate any profit to charity.[39]
Personal life[edit]
Robertson's second wife, Jennifer H. Dempsie, is a former advisor to Alex Salmond. She campaigned to inherit Salmond's Scottish Parliament seat in Aberdeenshire East[40] but withdrew to focus on her business career.[41][failed verification]Outside politics Robertson is a music fan, and particularly likes Metallica and Belle and Sebastian.[42] He is a supporter of the Heart of Midlothian football team.[43]On 29 May 2021, he announced the birth of his second child.[44]
Honours[edit]
In August 2016, he was awarded the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold for Services to the Austrian Republic.[45]

Personal detailsBornAnnabel MacNicoll Goldie (1950-02-27) 27 February 1950 (age 73)Glasgow, ScotlandCitizenshipBritishPolitical partyConservativeAlma materUniversity of StrathclydeProfessionSolicitorWebsiteBlogProfile: scottishconservatives.comAnnabel MacNicoll Goldie, Baroness Goldie DL (born 27 February 1950) is a Scottish politician and life peer who served as Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party from 2005 to 2011 and Minister of State for Defence from 2019 to 2023. She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), as one of the additional members for the West Scotland region, from 1999 to 2016.

Early life and career[edit]
Annabel MacNicoll Goldie was born in Glasgow, Scotland and raised in Kilmacolm and Lochwinnoch in Renfrewshire.[1] She attended Kilmacolm Primary School and Greenock Academy; she was head girl at Greenock.[2] She went on to study at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, graduating with an LL.B in 1971. Prior to entering politics, she was a solicitor and partner with Glasgow law firm Donaldson, Alexander, Russell & Haddow from 1978 to 2006.[3]
Political career[edit]
Goldie first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election for the Renfrew West and Inverclyde constituency, coming second with 32.9% of the vote.[4]Goldie was elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 1999 election as a regional member for the West of Scotland electoral region. She has retained this seat in the 2003, 2007 and 2011 elections. She became leader of the Scottish Conservatives in 2005 until standing down in 2011.
In addition to her appearance on the regional list ballots, she also stood as a candidate in the West Renfrewshire constituency for the Scottish Parliament in 1999, 2003 and 2007. While increasing the Conservative share of the vote each time, she was not elected although she raised her position from third to second place in 2007 with a reduced Labour majority. West Renfrewshire was abolished at the 2011 election, with Goldie unsuccessfully contending the new Renfrewshire North and West constituency.
On 31 October 2005, Goldie became acting leader after David McLetchie resigned as leader of the Scottish Conservatives following adverse publicity created by the publishing of details of expenses he claimed for taxi journeys.[5]Goldie put herself forward as a leadership candidate on 2 November 2005—a joint nomination with Murdo Fraser as her proposed deputy.[6] Their nomination was unopposed and Goldie was appointed leader on 8 November 2005, the first woman to lead the Scottish Conservative Party. In her maiden speech as leader, she promised to act against ""disloyalty and disobedience"" in the party and in a reference to Margaret Thatcher she said, ""I think you may take it matron's handbag will be in hyper-action. There could be worse precedents to follow"".[7]At her first party conference in March 2006, Goldie set out her plans to make the Scottish Conservatives the ""principal party of opposition in Scotland"". However, her second conference as party leader was overshadowed by a leaked memo by David Mundell, the only Scottish Conservative MP in the House of Commons, and Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, in which he criticised Goldie's leadership.[8]Goldie won praise for her leadership of the party into the 2007 Scottish Parliament election and personally as a skilled debater, and was labelled a ""much-liked public figure"".[9] From February 2009 onwards, she was given monthly attendance rights to participate in the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet in Westminster.[10]
Annabel Goldie's official parliamentary portrait in 2011On 9 May 2011, Goldie stated her intention to resign as leader of the Scottish Conservatives, citing her party's disappointing election result; she stood down on 4 November following the election of Ruth Davidson as her successor. Goldie later served as the party's culture and communities and served as the party's constitutional spokesperson during the 2014 Scottish referendum and stood down from the Parliament at the 2016 election.
Goldie was put on the 2013 list as a Conservative working peer in the House of Lords[11] and was created a life peer on 3 October 2013, taking the title Baroness Goldie, of Bishopton in the County of Renfrewshire.[12] In June 2016, she was appointed a Baroness-in-Waiting in the Royal Household, acting as a whip in the UK Government. She was promoted in July 2019 to Minister of State for Defence.[13] She was later reappointed by Liz Truss[14] and Rishi Sunak[15] respectively.
She has identified the need for the armed forces to address climate change, and to improve the experience of women in the forces, as among her priorities.[16]
Personal life[edit]
Goldie lives in Bishopton, Renfrewshire.[1] She is also an Elder in the Church of Scotland, and sits on the West of Scotland Advisory Board of the Salvation Army. She is a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Renfrewshire.[17]

Personal detailsBorn (1960-08-20) 20 August 1960 (age 63)NationalityScottishPolitical partyScottish National PartyParent(s)Winnie EwingStewart EwingRelativesFergus Ewing (brother)Alma materUniversity of GlasgowProfessionSolicitorAnnabelle Janet Ewing[1] (born 20 August 1960) is a Scottish politician and lawyer who has served as Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, alongside Liam McArthur, since May 2021.  A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Cowdenbeath constituency since 2016, having previously been an MSP for the Mid Scotland and Fife region from 2011 to 2016.
Ewing previously served in the British House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for Perth, from 2001 to 2005. She was Scotland's Minister for Youth and Women's Employment from 2014 to 2016, and Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs from 2016 to 2018. Her brother, Fergus Ewing, is also an MSP in the Scottish Parliament, and their mother, Winnie Ewing, previously served as an MSP, MP and MEP.[2]
Background[edit]
Ewing was born on 20 August 1960 to Winnifred Margaret Ewing (née Woodburn) and Stewart Martin Ewing. Her mother was a prominent former Scottish politician. She attended Craigholme School for Girls in Glasgow and the University of Glasgow, where she graduated with a law degree.[1]Before becoming an MP, Ewing was a European Community competition lawyer in Brussels and ran a small legal practice.
She lives in Perthshire. Her mother was former SNP President, Winnie Ewing, who in the past was a member of three different parliaments — Westminster, the Scottish Parliament and the European Parliament. Her brother is MSP Fergus Ewing, and her sister-in-law was the late Margaret Ewing, who had been an MSP and an MP.[3] Her late father, Stewart Ewing was elected as an SNP district councillor for the Summerston Ward in Glasgow 1977, when he gained it from Dick Dynes, then-leader of the Labour Group on Glasgow District Council, a result described at the time by The Glasgow Herald as ""an absolute sensation"".[4]Ewing is a member of Shelter and Amnesty International. She has been involved in a number of Parliamentary campaigns, including fighting for the rights of people with Hepatitis C, and working to gain a public enquiry into the events at Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, where James Collinson, a constituent, died on 23 March 2002.[5][6]
Political career[edit]
Ewing was first selected as a SNP candidate for the UK Parliament to contest a by-election for Hamilton South in 1999, the constituency where her mother had won a famous by-election victory in 1967.[7] Labour had a comfortable majority at the 1997 election and despite a swing of 16% to the SNP in 1999, Labour's Bill Tynan won the seat.[8]In 2001, Ewing stood for the UK Parliament again, this time in Perth, where Roseanna Cunningham had been the MP. Ewing was elected, defeating the Conservative candidate by just 48 votes,[9][10] giving her the narrowest majority in Scotland. In the 2005 election, following a boundary revision, she contested the new constituency of Ochil and South Perthshire, losing to the Labour party candidate, Gordon Banks.
She sought to become SNP candidate for Moray in the 27 April 2006 Scottish Parliament by-election to succeed her late sister-in-law, Margaret Ewing. She was defeated by North East Scotland MSP Richard Lochhead[11] who went on to win the seat in the by-election.
She was later selected to contest the Falkirk East seat in the 2007 election on behalf of the SNP as a replacement for the previously selected candidate, the late Douglas Henderson. On 3 May 2007 she achieved a 9% swing from Labour to the SNP in Falkirk East, however this was not enough to displace the incumbent Cathy Peattie.
She contested Ochil and South Perthshire for a second time at the 2010 election, failing again to take it from Gordon Banks, this time on an increased (4%) swing away from the SNP to Labour. At the 2011 election Ewing was elected to the Scottish Parliament as an additional member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region.
She is famed due to an incident that occurred on 16 December 2004, whereby the Deputy Speaker removed her from the House as she refused to apologise for calling the then Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon a ""back-stabbing coward""[12] during exchanges over Geoff Hoon's plans to merge Scottish Regiments, including the Black Watch.[13]She was promoted to the Scottish Government on 21 November 2014 in Nicola Sturgeon's first Cabinet reshuffle. She became Minister for Youth and Women's Employment, transferring to the Community Safety and Legal Affairs portfolio in 2016. She left the government in June 2018.[14]After being re-elected in the 2021 election, Ewing was elected as one of the two Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament.[15] On 20 April 2023, after a particularly robust intervention from Fergus Ewing on the subject of gas extraction, she had to remind him officially about treating fellow members with respect. First Minister Humza Yousaf then quipped that he suspected it was not the first time she had had to tell her brother off.[16]

She has been SNP Spokesperson for International Development since 2023.[2]She was previously a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 2009 to 2011. She was elected to the House of Commons at the 2015 general election but was defeated at the 2017 general election by Paul Sweeney of Scottish Labour. At the 2019 general election, McLaughlin regained the seat with a majority of 2,548 votes.

Early life and political activity[edit]
McLaughlin was born and raised in Greenock but has lived in Glasgow for many years. She attended Port Glasgow High School until 1984, then attended the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and the University of Glasgow.[3] She joined the SNP after the 1988 Govan by-election.[1]She contested Glasgow Springburn in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, finishing second, and had previously contested the Glasgow Rutherglen seat at the 2001 UK general election (again finishing second) and the similar Glasgow Rutherglen seat at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election.[1] She was SNP campaign co-ordinator when John Mason won the 2008 Glasgow East by-election.[4]
Member of the Scottish Parliament: 2009–2011[edit]
McLaughlin became a regional member for Glasgow on 6 February 2009, following the death of Bashir Ahmad, as the next person on the SNP's regional list. Before this she was employed as a researcher for the MSP Bob Doris. She has championed the cause of English language skills in Glasgow school-children.[5] She was a member of the Public Audit and Public Petitions parliamentary committees (2009–2011).[6]She contested the Glasgow Provan constituency in the May 2011 Scottish Parliament election but was unsuccessful.[7]
2011 Inverclyde by-election[edit]
She was chosen by party members at a selection meeting in Greenock to contest the Inverclyde constituency in the June 2011 UK Parliament by-election.[8] However, Labour retained the seat on a 5,835 majority - down from 14,416 - on a reduced turnout.[9]
Member of the UK Parliament: 2015–2017, 2019–present[edit]
McLaughlin was elected to the UK Parliament in the 2015 general election, for the Glasgow North East constituency. She won the seat from the incumbent Labour MP Willie Bain on a swing of 39%, breaking the record for the biggest swing at a general election.[10] She then however narrowly lost her seat to Labour candidate Paul Sweeney at the snap general election in 2017.[11]McLaughlin regained the seat from Sweeney at the snap general election in 2019 with a majority of 2,548 votes.[12]

She was previously a Scottish Labour Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region from 2011 to 2016.

Background[edit]
Anne McTaggart was a Community Development worker[2] and chair of the local school Blairdardie Primary's parents council, before being elected to Glasgow City Council in a by-election in 2009.[3][4]
Political career[edit]
html bodyhtml@media(min-width:720px){}This section of a biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification. Please help by adding reliable sources.

Councillor[edit]
She was elected as a Councillor in the Drumchapel/Anniesland ward of Glasgow City Council at a by-election (on 4 June 2009).[4][6] The seat was previously held by SNP MSP Bill Kidd, who resigned in April 2009 to focus on his parliamentary activities by ending his dual mandate as councillor and MSP.[7]She sat on five Committees, including the Personnel Appeals Committee, and was a member of the Education Children and Families Policy Development Committee[8] and the West Local Community Planning Partnership.[9] In addition she was a Councillor member of Glasgow Regeneration Agency 2011 Ltd.[10]A year after becoming an MSP, she did not seek re-election to Glasgow City Council in the 2012 local election, thus ending her dual mandate.

Scottish Parliament[edit]
McTaggart was elected as a list MSP for the Glasgow region in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.[11] The result was something of a surprise, as Labour lost five local constituency seats to the SNP and had three members selected from their additional list (from none in 2007), the last of whom was McTaggart.[2]She was Scottish Labour's Shadow Minister for Democracy, a member of the European and External Relations Committee and a Substitute member of the Equal Opportunities Committee.
McTaggart received cross-party support to become Convener of the Cross Party Group on Poland, and Deputy Convenor of the following Scottish Parliament CPGs: Credit Unions, Social Enterprise and Tibet.
In November 2012, the BBC reported that McTaggart used her Parliamentary expenses to purchase books including Public Speaking and Presentation for Dummies, The Scottish Parliament: An Introduction and several books on Labour politician Barbara Castle. The books were purchased for her mentoring scheme to encourage access to politics for women.[12][13]In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, McTaggart did not stand for a constituency and was selected in twelfth position on the Labour additional member list for Glasgow,[14] effectively ending her tenure before the vote took place (a large number of the candidates listed above her would have to win their constituency seat, in addition to several more as well as her being added from the region, almost an impossibility under the proportional system).

Return to council[edit]
After losing her Holyrood seat, in the 2017 Glasgow City Council election she was returned as a Councillor, again in the Drumchapel/Anniesland ward.
In November 2019, she announced that she joined the Scottish National Party and said that the Scottish Labour was not doing a good job in Glasgow.[1]

Personal detailsBornCarol Ann Wells (1972-02-24) 24 February 1972 (age 51)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesOccupationFood retail managerWebsitewww.anniewells.org.ukCarol Ann ""Annie"" Wells (born 24 February 1972) is a British politician of the  Scottish Conservatives, who served as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party to Jackson Carlaw in 2020. She has served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region since 2016.
The Deputy Leadership position was abolished on 12 August 2020, shortly after Douglas Ross was appointed Scottish Conservative Leader.

Early life and career[edit]
Hailing from Springburn, Wells worked as a retail manager for Marks & Spencer in various locations throughout Glasgow for the 12 years leading up to her election.[1][2]
Political career[edit]
Wells became involved in politics during the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum by joining the Better Together campaign and stood as the Scottish Conservative candidate in Glasgow North East in the 2015 general election, finishing third with 4.7% of the vote.[3] She also unsuccessfully contested the Glasgow Provan constituency at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, finishing third with 8.6% of the vote, but was elected via the Glasgow regional list.[4][5]Shortly after her election, Wells was made Scottish Conservative Spokesperson for Welfare Reform and Equalities.[6] She sits on the Equal Opportunities Committee of the Scottish Parliament.[7]In late 2018, Wells was banned from Holyrood for leaking an embargoed committee report to the press. After a complaint was made that the MSP had ""sought political advantage"" by speaking out about prisoner voting before a report had been published, the parliament's standards committee unanimously ruled that Wells had breached the code of conduct for MSPs.[8]Wells served as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, alongside Liam Kerr, under Jackson Carlaw. However, they both were dismissed and the post was abolished when Douglas Ross became leader in August 2020.[9]On 12 January 2022, Wells called for Boris Johnson to resign as Conservative party leader and Prime Minister over the Westminster lockdown parties controversy along with a majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs.[10]In July 2022, she endorsed Penny Mordaunt in the Conservative Party leadership election.[11]
Personal life[edit]
Wells is a single mother and is a lesbian.[1][12]

   ​ ​(m. 2000; div. 2020)​Children2Alma materKeele University Open UniversityAshten Regan (formerly Denham, born Sarah Jane Regan; 8 March 1974) is a Scottish politician. She has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Edinburgh Eastern since 2016. Initially elected to parliament for the Scottish National Party (SNP), she defected to the Alba Party.[1][2] Regan served under First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as the minister for community safety from 2018 until she resigned in 2022 in protest against her government's Gender Recognition Reform bill. 
A native of Biggar, Regan moved to Devon, England, and studied international relations at Keele University in Staffordshire. After graduating, she moved to London – working in public relations – and gained a diploma at the London School of Public Relations. She returned to Scotland in 2003. She earned a Master of Science in development management at the Open University and worked in digital marketing. She first got involved in politics when she became head of campaigns and advocacy at the Common Weal, a left-wing pro-Scottish independence think tank. In the campaign for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Regan actively campaigned for Yes Scotland and was a member of the Women for Independence's national committee. In the aftermath of the referendum defeat, she joined the SNP and was later selected as a candidate for the Edinburgh Eastern constituency in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. After a successful campaign, she sat as a backbencher, before being appointed to the Scottish Government in First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's 2018 cabinet reshuffle. Regan resigned in October 2022 in protest against the Gender Recognition Reform Bill, the first SNP minister to resign to vote against government policy since the party entered office in 2007. 
Following the announcement of Sturgeon's intention to resign the leadership of the SNP and as First Minister of Scotland, Regan announced her candidacy in the 2023 leadership contest. Her campaign was endorsed by Alba Party leader and former SNP leader and first minister, Alex Salmond. She finished in third place of three candidates with 11.1% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round of voting. On 28 October 2023, Regan announced her defection from the SNP to the Alba Party and was subsequently appointed the party's parliamentary leader. She is the first Alba Party member of the Scottish Parliament, having been elected as an SNP member. 

Early life[edit]
Sarah Jane Regan [3] was born in Biggar, South Lanarkshire,[4] on 8 March 1974.[citation needed] Her father, a Catholic, and her mother, a Protestant were from the city of Glasgow, where her mother owned a kilt shop on Sauchiehall Street.[5] Regan attended primary school in Scotland, before moving with her family to North Devon in England aged ten.[6][7] When she was fifteen years old, Regan changed her birth forename in a deed poll to Ashten, to avoid confusion with another girl in her school who shared the same name.[8]Regan attended Keele University in England from 1992 to 1995, gaining a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations.[9][10] She was the first in her family to attend university.[11] She was a writer for Concourse magazine, a student newspaper of the Keele University Students' Union. After graduating she moved to London and earned a diploma in public relations at the London School of Public Relations.[12]She briefly lived in Australia.[6] Regan married Robert Denham in 2000, and they had twin boys.[13][14] They returned to Scotland in 2003.[15]In 2007, Regan studied Development Management at the Open University, gaining a Master of Science in 2012.[12]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Keele University, Regan worked as a PR and Marketing Officer at ScottClem for three years. She then went on to work as a Senior Account Executive at Spreckley Partners, before becoming Events Executive in late 2002 for Zinc Management. From December 2002 to August 2003, Regan was an Account Manager for Rocket PR.[12]In October 2012, after graduating from the OU, she worked remotely in Digital Marketing at Tearfund. Returning to Scotland, Regan became Head of Campaigns and Advocacy at the Common Weal, before her election to Holyrood.[12][14]
Political career[edit]
Early political involvement[edit]
At a dinner party in 2012, Regan was asked by guests for her opinion on the 2014 Scottish independence vote. Her then husband, who was born in England, assumed Regan would vote 'No'; however, after she conducted research she had found herself to be more leaning towards the 'Yes' movement.[5]Regan joined Women for Independence and was active in the Yes Scotland campaign. In January 2014, she was elected to the national committee for Women for Independence.[16] She recalled being “really passionate about Scotland becoming an independent country – I felt the arguments were really strong and I wanted Scotland to have more democratic choice”.[5] Regan was an events co-ordinator for YES Scottish Borders.[12][better source needed]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
Following the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign in the referendum, Regan joined the Scottish National Party. In August 2015, she  was selected as the SNP candidate for the Edinburgh Eastern constituency in the upcoming 2016 Scottish Parliament elections after the incumbent MSP Kenny MacAskill, had announced in June that he would not stand for re-election.[17][18] She was elected, defeating the Leader of the Scottish Labour Party Kezia Dugdale.

Backbencher[edit]
In June 2016, Regan was appointed as Parliamentary Liaison Officer to the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs.[19] She was a member of the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work Committee and the Finance and Constitution Committee.[20] In November 2017, she was moved from the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work committee to the Health and Sport Committee, where she was appointed deputy convener.

Community safety minister (2018–2022)[edit]
On 27 June 2018, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that she would perform a cabinet reshuffle of her second government. Sturgeon appointed Regan as the Minister for Community Safety, succeeding Annabelle Ewing.[21]In April 2019, Regan was one of 15 SNP politicians who signed a public letter calling on the Scottish government to delay reform to the Gender Recognition Act, which would make it easier for transgender people to legally change their gender.[22] Later that month, an exchange between Regan and fellow SNP MSPs Gillian Martin and Ruth Maguire was leaked. In it, they expressed frustration at Nicola Sturgeon and claimed she was out of step with the SNP group.[23][24]In June 2019, it was reported that a number of her ex-employees received pay-offs worth thousands of pounds and some signed non-disclosure agreements.[25]Regan faced a selection challenge in 2021, from a local councillor.[26]In the 2021 Scottish elections, Regan was re-elected, this time increasing her vote share by more than 8,000.[27] Sturgeon reappointed Regan as community safety minister in the third Sturgeon government.[28]On 27 October 2022 Regan resigned, citing concerns over the Scottish Government's support for the Gender Recognition Reform Bill.[29][30]Elena Whitham succeeded her as Minister for Community Safety in November, subject to parliamentary approval.[31]
2023 SNP leadership election[edit]
Main article: 2023 Scottish National Party leadership election
LogoOn 18 February 2023, Regan declared her candidacy in the 2023 SNP leadership election, following the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon.[32]Regan said she would not introduce laws that would ""[make] things more difficult for businesses"" or ""interfere with family life"".[12][better source needed]Regan received 5,599 votes, equating to 11.1% of the overall vote share.[33]
Alba Party[edit]
During the SNP leadership election, Regan was advised by a former staffer to Alex Salmond who had run as an Alba Party candidate against the SNP  the year prior,[34] and the only SNP parliamentarian to endorse her is  close to Salmond. On 28 October 2023, less than six months after coming third (out of 3 candidates) in the contest, she left the SNP and joined the Alba Party, becoming the first MSP ever to directly[35] defect from one party to another.[1]Regan said she was leaving as she thought the SNP had ""lost its focus on independence"". The Herald reported that Regan, who joined the SNP in 2014, seven and a half years after the SNP were first elected to government, ""claimed that her old party had been hollowed out by careerists whose views did not align with the core beliefs of the SNP"".[36]As the sole MSP for Alba, Regan became their first representation in the Scottish Parliament, and one of three elected members at any level of government, alongside MPs Kenny MacAskill, her predecessor as MSP now deputy leader of the party, and Neale Hanvey, all of who were elected while members of the SNP.[1]
Political views[edit]
Social issues[edit]
Regan at a demonstration against the Gender Recognition Reform Bill on 21 December 2022.Regan opposed the SNP's Gender Recognition Reform Bill, which sought to amend the provisions of the UK Gender Recognition Act to make the process of bureaucratically transitioning less difficult and more fair.[12][37] In 2019, she urged ministers to delay the bill, and, following that delay, in 2022 resigned from her ministerial role in order to vote against it.[38]During the debate on the Bill, her SNP colleague  Emma Roddick MSP criticised  Regan for misgendering a constituent during that debate.[39]
Independence[edit]
On independence, Regan said that instead of Sturgeon's proposal to use the next Scottish Parliament or House of Commons election as a de facto referendum on Scottish independence, she would begin negotiations with the UK government on independence the next time political parties supporting Scottish independence received more than half of the vote collectively in an election to either parliament.[40] She said she would establish a constitutional convention with other political parties and organisations that support Scottish independence.[41]
Environment[edit]
Regan said she wanted to slow down plans to achieve net zero carbon emissions by phasing out extraction of oil and natural gas from the North Sea.[42] She also committed to prioritising upgrading roads, including converting the A9 road to a dual carriageway faster than planned.[43]

Wishart stood in the 2017 Scottish local elections as an independent candidate for Shetland Islands Council, being elected as one of four members for the Lerwick South ward.[3] After the election she was appointed depute convenor of the council.[4]In July 2019 she was selected as a candidate for the Scottish Liberal Democrats for the 2019 Shetland by-election scheduled for 29 August, having been associated with the party for the previous decade – running the offices of Alistair Carmichael, MP for Orkney and Shetland, and the outgoing MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott.[3] The campaign was hard-fought; the SNP spent £100,000 on the by-election – more money than the party spent during the entire EU referendum – and there was a swing of over 14% to their candidate.[5] Wishart held the seat for the Scottish Liberal Democrats with a majority of 1,837 votes or 15.5%. She made her maiden speech in the Scottish Parliament on 10 September 2019, which concerned immigration into Scotland after Brexit.[6]Shortly after being elected, Wishart was appointed as education spokesperson for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, and was made a member of the Scottish Parliament's Education and Skills Committee. Wishart, who had previously worked on the Shetland Islands Council's Education and Families Committee, stressed her belief that ""getting a high quality education helps people meet their full potential in life"".[7] Since February 2020, Wishart has also sat on the Scottish Parliament's Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee, taking over from Mike Rumbles.[8]In a letter to Nicola Sturgeon in April 2020, Wishart suggested that the Shetland Islands could be ""the ideal place to pilot an exit strategy from lockdown"", which had been put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wishart cited as ""encouraging"" statements made by Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor at the University of Aberdeen, who had noted that ""there could soon be a case for a geographical lifting of restrictions – such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian"".[9] Later that month, Wishart was appointed as a member of the Scottish Parliament's COVID-19 Committee.[10]At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Wishart was re-elected with a majority of 806 votes, the third smallest majority of that election.[11]

Early life and education[edit]
Macpherson attended Flora Stevenson Primary School and then George Heriot's School.[2] He then graduated from the University of York with a degree in philosophy and politics. He later studied law at the University of Edinburgh.[3]As a youth, Macpherson was involved in the local Labour Party.[1] When he was sixteen, he did work experience with his local MSP Malcolm Chisholm, whose constituency he later represented.[1] He became a member of the SNP in 2005,[3] having left Labour in 2003 due to the Iraq War and lack of progress on social inclusion.[1]He worked in a number of different roles and sectors, including time as a bartender, for a wave energy company and as a clerical assistant at James Gillespie's High School.[1] He then trained as a lawyer, working for the firm Brodies.[1]In the summer of 2004 he walked from Edinburgh to London to raise awareness of the annual International Day of Peace.[4] Growing up he was a keen footballer and played for several teams in Edinburgh and the University of York's 1st Team.[5][1] In 2003, he lived briefly in China, working as a volunteer English teacher in Wujiang.[5]

Ben Wallace's voice

Wallace opens a panel of defence ministers at the 2020 Conservative Party ConferenceRecorded 5 October 2020
Robert Ben Lobban Wallace (born 15 May 1970) is a British politician and former British Army Officer who served as Secretary of State for Defence from 2019 to 2023. A member of the Conservative Party, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wyre and Preston North, formerly Lancaster and Wyre, since 2005.
Before becoming involved in politics, Wallace was a captain in the Scots Guards. He was elected in 1999 as a Conservative list Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for North East Scotland, serving until 2003.[1][2] He subsequently resigned from the Scottish Parliament, moved to Lancashire and sought selection for a Westminster constituency in England.[3][4] First elected to the UK Parliament in 2005, Wallace served as a backbencher for nearly five years. From 2010 to 2014, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Secretary of State for Justice, Ken Clarke. Wallace served as a party whip from July 2014 to May 2015.
Following the 2015 general election and the formation of the majority Cameron government, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Northern Ireland Office. In 2016, he was appointed Minister of State for Security and Economic Crime by Theresa May, holding the position until she left office in July 2019. A supporter of Boris Johnson, Wallace was promoted to the senior cabinet role of Secretary of State for Defence, after Johnson became Prime Minister. He continued the role under Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, making him the longest serving member of the Cabinet to serve continuously in the same position until he left office.[5]In July 2023, he announced that he intended to resign as Secretary of State for Defence at the next Cabinet reshuffle, and that he would not be seeking re-election as an MP at the next general election.[6] In August 2023, Wallace formally resigned as Secretary of State for Defence.[7]
Early life[edit]
Wallace was born on 15 May 1970 in Farnborough, Kent.[8][9] His father was a soldier in the 1st King's Dragoon Guards and served in Malaya.[10]Wallace was educated at Millfield, a private school in Somerset.[11] While at school, he attended a young officers’ course for the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, and after leaving school was interviewed by the Regular Commissions Board.[10] He then spent some time as a ski instructor at the Austrian National Ski School in the village of Alpbach in Austria.[12]
Military career[edit]
After training as a cadet at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, in June 1991 Wallace was commissioned into the Scots Guards as a second lieutenant, with a short service commission.[13] From 1991 to 1998, he served in Germany, Cyprus, Belize, and Northern Ireland.[2] In April 1993, he was promoted lieutenant,[14] and later that year was mentioned in dispatches[15] for an incident in Belfast where the patrol he was commanding captured an entire IRA active service unit (ASU) attempting to carry out a bomb attack against British troops.[2][16] The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) later said that no one arrested as a result of the patrol was prosecuted.[17] In 1996 he was promoted captain.[18]Wallace was on duty on the night of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and was a member of the party sent to Paris to bring home her body.[19]In June 1998, Wallace transferred from the Active List to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers as a captain, thereby ending his active service and beginning a period of call-up liability.[20] He later explained that he had decided against seeking to become a regular officer and to continue after the age of thirty, as the part of the work he had really enjoyed was commanding soldiers, and this was likely to diminish after that point.[10]Wallace is a member of the Royal Company of Archers, a ceremonial unit that serves as the Sovereign's bodyguard in Scotland. As such, he participated in the vigil over the Queen's coffin as she lay in state in Westminster Hall on 15 September 2022.[21]
Political career[edit]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
Wallace entered politics after leaving the army, citing as a reason for this decision the experience he had commanding men from some of the UK's most economically deprived areas, which he averred could be improved by promoting a more aspirational society.[16] Wallace became a Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, as a list MSP for North East Scotland.[3][4] He did not seek re-election at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, as he sought selection for a Westminster constituency in England.[3][4] Wallace was the Scottish Conservatives' shadow health spokesman during that time.[4]From 2003 to 2005 he was overseas director of the aerospace company QinetiQ, the UK's former Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).[11]
Member of UK Parliament[edit]
Wallace was elected as Member of Parliament for the Lancaster and Wyre constituency at the 2005 general election. He gained the seat from Labour with 22,266 votes and a majority of 4,171 (8.0%).[22]Wallace faced local criticism after it was revealed that in 2008 he had made the fourth-highest expenses claim of any MP, claiming £175,523 on top of his £63,000 salary. However, he defended this by arguing that his constituency had an electorate that was nearly 20% larger than the average one in England.[23]His constituency was abolished for the 2010 general election, and Wallace was instead returned for the new seat of Wyre and Preston North with 26,877 votes and a majority of 15,844 (30.9%).[24] He was re-elected at the 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections, with majorities suggesting he now held a safe seat for his party.[25]Wallace does not intend to remain in Parliament beyond the next general election, and his constituency will be abolished by boundary changes at the next general election.[6]From 2005 to 2010, Wallace was a member of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons.[26] From 2006 to 2010 he was also the Shadow Minister of State for Scotland and was Chairman of the British–Iran Parliamentary Group from 2006 to 2014. He was awarded Campaigner of the Year in the annual Spectator/Threadneedle Parliamentarian Awards in 2008, for his work promoting transparency of MPs' expenses.[27][28]
Junior ministerial roles and EU referendum[edit]
Following his re-election to Parliament in 2010, Wallace was appointed as parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the then Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, and later minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, Kenneth Clarke.[19] On 4 September 2012, Wallace turned down a position as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury during the cabinet reshuffle[citation needed] to remain Clarke's PPS.[29] He voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, which legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales.[30]In July 2014, as Clarke returned to the back benches, Wallace was again offered a job in Government as a whip. This time he accepted. 
Also in 2014, he became an early supporter of a future leadership bid by Boris Johnson, who was not then in parliament.[19]In May 2015, Wallace was promoted to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Northern Ireland Office.
Early in 2016, with the approach of the European Union referendum, Boris Johnson was wavering between Leave and Remain, and Wallace advised him strongly to support Remain, as taking the Leave side would mean being allied with ""clowns"".[19] Wallace himself supported the Remain side before the referendum.[31] After it had been won by Leave, David Cameron resigned as party leader. Johnson at once launched a leadership campaign run by Wallace and Lynton Crosby. However, a week later, after Michael Gove had decided to stand as well, Johnson withdrew.[19]The new Prime Minister, Theresa May, promoted Wallace to Minister of State for Security in the Home Office. He voted for her Brexit withdrawal agreement in early 2019, and against any referendum on that agreement.[32]In December 2017, Wallace’s ministerial portfolio was extended to include economic crime. He was Security Minister during the terror attacks of 2017 and the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. Wallace was appointed to the Privy Council for his role in coordinating the government response to the 2017 Westminster attack.[33]
Secretary of State for Defence[edit]
Wallace (left) meeting with the United States Secretary of Defense Mark Esper at Horse Guards in September 2019Wallace (right) and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon, in July 2021On 24 July 2019, Boris Johnson became Prime Minister and immediately appointed Wallace as Secretary of State for Defence, replacing Penny Mordaunt,[34] who was left out of the new government.[35]In August 2019, Wallace was overheard discussing Johnson's controversial prorogation of parliament with Florence Parly, the French Armed Forces minister. He suggested that the reason for the prorogation for five weeks was to prevent MPs from blocking the government's Brexit plans, rather than the government's official position that it was to introduce a new legislative agenda.[36]10 Downing Street responded to his comments by admonishing him and stating that he had ""misspoken"".[37] This prorogation was deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court on 24 September 2019.[38]On 13 October 2019, in a NATO meeting, Wallace defended the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria. He commented, ""Turkey needs to do what it sometimes has to do to defend itself"". His comments were condemned by other delegates at the meeting.[39][40]On 12 January 2020, in an interview with The Sunday Times, Wallace said that the UK ""must be prepared to fight wars without the US"", one of the UK's key allies. He stated that the upcoming defence review ""should be used to make the UK less dependent on the US in future conflicts"". His comments were made in response to US President Donald Trump's ""America First"" isolationist policies. Wallace also said that the next defence review would be the ""deepest review"" of Britain's defence and foreign policies since the end of the Cold War in 1991.[41]On 15 March 2021, as part of the Integrated Review, Wallace released a command paper titled Defence in a Competitive Age, in which he detailed ""a mission to seek out and to understand future threats, and to invest in the capabilities to defeat them,"" promising an expenditure of £188 billion on defence over the next four years.[42]
Wallace with senior British Army officers at the Household Division Military Musical Spectacular in 2022In July 2021, Wallace said that the United States had left Britain in a ""very difficult position"" following the withdrawal of most US troops from Afghanistan.[43] Soon after the withdrawal of US troops had started, the Taliban had launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of a collapsing Afghan Armed Forces.[44] Wallace said the UK would be ready to work with the Taliban should they come to power provided they adhere to certain international norms.[45]On 16 August 2021, during a radio interview on LBC about the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Wallace was asked by an LBC interviewer, ""why do you feel it so personally, Mr Wallace?"" He replied with emotion: ""because I'm a soldier ... because it's sad, and the West has done what it's done and we have to do our very best to get people out and stand by our obligations"".[46]Wallace was the minister responsible for the British evacuation from Kabul, Operation Pitting. He was involved in a controversial decision to allow Pen Farthing – who ran an animal sanctuary in Kabul – to evacuate 71 people and more than 100 animals from Kabul to the UK.[47][48] Wallace said Ministry of Defence staff had suffered abuse from some of Farthing's supporters, who alleged the government had initially abandoned Farthing.[49]In December 2021, Wallace met with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss cooperation in various fields, especially defence, having discussed similar matters the previous year with Saudi Arabia's vice defence minister Prince Khalid bin Salman.[50][51]In 2022, at an event to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of the Falklands War, Wallace declared Britain's determination to ""stand up to bullies"".[52] His words were decried as ""belligerent threats"" and ""denigrating references"" by Argentina.[53]
Wallace with Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu in Moscow in February 2022. Shoigu denied that Russia was planning an invasion of Ukraine.Wallace met Sergei Shoigu, the Russian Minister of Defence in Moscow on 11 February 2022.[54] Shoigu reiterated a denial of any Russian intentions to invade Ukraine.[6] The following day, Wallace said that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was ""highly likely"", and British citizens were being told by the Foreign Office to evacuate while commercial means were still available.[55] Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, said Wallace's comparison of diplomatic efforts with Russia to the appeasement policies of the 1930s was unhelpful,[56] saying now is the wrong time to ""offend our partners"".[57] On 23 February 2022, Wallace was filmed saying that the Scots Guards ""kicked the backside"" of Nicholas I of Russia during the Crimean War, and could do so again. Russia invaded Ukraine the following day.[58]On 21 March 2022, clipped footage of Wallace in a prank call by Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus was released online. The duo (suspected by the British government to have links to Russian security services or of being Russian state actors)[59][60] impersonated the Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal saying that Ukraine wished to promote its own nuclear deterrent to protect itself from Russia, a false claim made by the Russian government during the Russo-Ukrainian War and the invasion of Ukraine.[59][60] Wallace was believed to be on a Microsoft Teams call with the duo for ten minutes.[61] That day, Wallace announced plans to reduce the number of British Army personnel from 76,500 to 72,500.[62]Wallace was perceived as responsible for initial British reluctance to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine in March 2022, saying that the idea ""wouldn't work"".[63][64] Boris Johnson and his German counterpart Olaf Scholz agreed on 8 April that both European allies would withhold their Western-designed main battle tanks from the fray. Johnson instead chose to backfill the Polish Army, thus allowing them to send their obsolete T-72s to Ukraine,[63] while they waited for their order of South Korean K2 Black Panther replacements.[65][66] Despite a planned reduction of the British tank fleet from 227 Challenger 2 tanks to 148 upgraded Challenger 3 tanks, there were no plans to send British tanks to the Ukrainians.[67] Wallace later announced that the number of Challenger 3 tanks required by the UK was under review.[5][8] In January 2023, the British position was reversed, and Challenger 2 tanks were supplied to Ukraine in March 2023.[68][69]Boris Johnson announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party in July 2022 following a series of mass resignations from his government. Wallace was seen as a contender to succeed him as party leader and thus Prime Minister, but on 10 July he ruled himself out from entering the contest. In a statement on Twitter, he said his focus was on his current job and ""keeping this great country safe"".[70] He later endorsed Liz Truss in the election.[71] Following the appointment of Truss as Prime Minister, Wallace was reappointed to his post on 6 September.[72] He retained his post when Rishi Sunak became prime minister on 25 October.
On 7 November, Wallace announced that the competition to build a new national flagship yacht would be scrapped with immediate effect.[73]On 21 June 2023, Wallace ruled himself out of the running to become the next NATO Secretary-General after rumours spread that the US were in favour of Jens Stoltenberg staying in post.[74]Speaking at a NATO summit in Lithuania on 11 July, Wallace said that Ukraine should offer more gratitude to Western allies of the country, following the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's frustration at not being given a formal invitation to join the NATO alliance. Wallace also said that American and British lawmakers felt that Ukraine was demanding an Amazon-style wishlist of demands in military aid.[75][76][77]On 15 July 2023, Wallace announced his intention to resign as Secretary of State for Defence at the next Cabinet reshuffle and confirmed that he would not be seeking re-election as an MP at the next general election.[6] By length of tenure, he was the longest-serving Conservative Secretary of State for Defence on record. Wallace was also the longest-serving participant in the current UK Cabinet by continuous service; attending without interruption since his 2016 appointment as Minister of State for Security.[78] On 31 August 2023, Wallace formally resigned as Secretary of State for Defence.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Wallace married Liza Cooke in 2001. They met when she was a researcher in the Scottish Parliament and Wallace was an MSP.[79] His wife worked as a part-time parliamentary assistant in his office until 30 April 2019.[80]
They have since separated.[81] He has described the burden of his job on his private life as one of the regrets of his political career.[6]The couple have two sons and a daughter.[9] His children were divided on whether Wallace should have made a pitch for the Conservative leadership in 2022.[6]Wallace divides his time between Lancashire and London.[82][83] Outside politics, he lists his recreations as skiing, sailing, rugby and horse racing.[84] He is a member of the Third Guards club.[9]

Personal detailsBornWilliam Mackie Aitken (1947-04-15) 15 April 1947 (age 76)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyConservativeResidenceGlasgowProfessioninsurance, legislatorWilliam Mackie Aitken (born 15 April 1947) is a Scottish Conservative politician.[1] He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow from 1999 to 2011, Scottish Conservative Spokesperson for Justice, and Convener of the Justice Committee from 2007 to 2011.

Background, education and career[edit]
Aitken was born in Glasgow, and educated at Allan Glen's School in the city and Glasgow College of Technology (now Glasgow Caledonian University).[1] He worked in the Financial Services/Insurance Industry for 34 years (1965–1999). He is a supporter of Partick Thistle Football Club. His interests include sports, reading and foreign travel.
Following involvement in youth politics he was elected a Glasgow City Councillor in 1977 for the Anniesland ward, subsequently becoming the Convener of the Licensing Committee and Vice Convener of the Personnel Committee. He served as Leader of the Opposition for two terms prior to becoming MSP for Glasgow in 1999. He was a District Court Judge (1985–2000), and is also a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy Lord Lieutenant of the Glasgow City Council (1993–present).
Following his election to the Scottish Parliament, he became Conservative Party Spokesman on Housing and Justice prior to becoming Chief Whip in 2003. He then became Scottish Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Justice and also the Convener of the Parliament's Justice Committee.[2] He was a trustee of the Scottish Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund.
On 19 May 2010, it was announced that he would step down at the next Holyrood election, to be held on 5 May 2011.[3]In February 2011 he caused controversy when he suggested that a woman who was recently gang raped in Glasgow may have been a prostitute, as the victim claimed that she was dragged from one side of the city centre to another, a location known for prostitution.[4][5] On 21 February 2011 he resigned as Convenor of the Scottish Parliament justice committee in response to this controversy.[6]

Personal detailsBornWilliam Archibald Bowman (1950-05-30) 30 May 1950 (age 73)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Conservative PartyEducationHigh School of GlasgowGeorge Watson's CollegeAlma materUniversity of EdinburghProfessionChartered AccountantWilliam Archibald Bowman (born 30 May 1950) is a Scottish Conservative Party politician who served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the North East Scotland region from December 2016 until he stood down at the 2021 election.
Born in Glasgow, Bowman was privately educated at the High School of Glasgow and George Watson's College. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a Bachelor of Commerce in 1973 and received accreditation as a chartered accountant in 1976. He subsequently joined accounting firm Peat Marwick, the predecessor of KPMG, working successively in their Edinburgh and Aberdeen offices until 2001. Having secured promotion as Deputy Senior Partner, Bowman moved to Bucharest in 2002, where he engaged with KPMG's operations in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), with a particular focus on Romania and Moldova.
Leaving KPMG, Bowman returned to the United Kingdom in 2013. He was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the Dundee East constituency at the 2015 general election, as well as the area's equivalent seat for the Scottish Parliament at the 2016 election, but finished third on both occasions. After the death of Conservative colleague Alex Johnstone in December 2016, Bowman was selected to replace him as an MSP for North East Scotland, having been positioned next on the regional list. Since his accession, he has become the Scottish Conservatives' Spokesperson for Taxation. Bowman has become well known for both his financial interests as well as his membership of various parliamentary committees and groupings.

Early life and career[edit]
William Archibald Bowman was born in Glasgow on 30 May 1950.[1] He was educated at the private High School of Glasgow and Edinburgh's George Watson's College, the latter from 1961 until 1968.[1][2] Bowman then went up to the University of Edinburgh,[3] where he graduated Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) in 1973.[1][2]After accreditation by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS), Bowman qualified as a chartered accountant in 1976.[1][3] In the same year, he joined the Edinburgh section of Peat Marwick, the predecessor of KPMG, before establishing himself as an early member of the firm's Aberdeen branch in 1981, becoming a partner in 1985.[1][3] There he remained until 2001, concurrently serving as a director of Aberdeen-based Target Energy Group Ltd between June and September 2000, before moving to Bucharest in 2002.[1][4] Bowman took up a role as Deputy Senior Partner of KPMG's operations in Romania and Moldova, as well as the wider Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region, serving on the Supervisory Committee of the latter.[1][2] Specialising in risk management and ethics, Bowman also served as an elected board member of the Chamber of Financial Auditors of Romania,[1]United Way Romania[5] and the Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce.[1] During this time, he was quoted regularly in the national media, most frequently in Wall-street.ro, an online business publication in Romania.[6]Leaving KPMG in 2012, Bowman joined the board of Bucharest's UTI Holdings in October of the same year, serving until April 2013.[2] In a declaration of financial interests, he is listed as a shareholder in a wide range of companies, most substantially in Glasgow-based quality assurance firm Tenairvia Consulting Ltd, dissolved in November 2017, for which he owned 100% of shares.[7] Other investments have included stakes in equity firms Simmons Private Equity, Vanguard S&P and Concept Fund Solutions PLC, investment fund Guttmann Investor, oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell, media organisation ITV, consumer goods producer Unilever and British American Tobacco.[7] Bowman's personal portfolio was quoted by The Courier & Advertiser in September 2018 as ""worth more than £600,000"".[8]
Political career[edit]
Bowman on the day of his accession to the Scottish Parliament, 21 December 2016Bowman returned to the United Kingdom later in 2013, settling in Fife.[1] He ""took up an active interest in politics"" shortly afterwards and was subsequently selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the Dundee East constituency in August 2014 to fight the upcoming general election of the following year.[2][3] Finishing third, behind incumbent Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament (MP) Stewart Hosie and Labour's Lesley Brennan, later briefly a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP),[9] Bowman captured 7,206 ballots, 15% of the total cast, a small reduction of 0.2% compared with the previous Conservative's vote share.[10][11] In a contemporary interview with the Financial Times, citing the predicted success of the SNP, Bowman stated: ""A lot of people I know are very concerned about the move to the left. The SNP is trying to out-Labour Labour, and Labour is trying to out-Labour itself"".[12]A month later, in June 2015, he was selected to fight the equivalent Scottish Parliament constituency of Dundee City East for the Scottish Conservatives.[1][2] Despite increasing the party's vote share by 7.6% with 4,969 ballots, Bowman again finished third in the 2016 contest, behind incumbent MSP Shona Robison of the SNP and Labour's Richard McCready.[13] His campaign predominantly advertised job creation, investment in public amenities and a commitment to advocate for the decentralisation of Police Scotland.[14] As of September 2018, he is a permanent resident of the city.[15]Upon the death of Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone in December 2016, Bowman was selected to replace him as a representative for North East Scotland, having been positioned next on the regional list.[16] He was sworn in as an MSP on 21 December by taking his Oath of Allegiance in the chamber of the Scottish Parliament.[16][17] Having joined the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work Committee, Bowman soon came under scrutiny by opposition politicians for selling nearly £30,000 worth of British American Tobacco shares on 12 January 2017, with Labour speculating whether he had done so on Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson's recommendation, perhaps in order to avoid public concern over vested interests.[18] Retorting, the Conservative group highlighted that ""[Bowman] has declared his shareholdings openly and in line with procedure, as have many other MSPs.""[18] Otherwise unusual for MSPs, he does not claim public funds to maintain a second abode in Edinburgh, the location of the Scottish Parliament, owing to his constituency's relative proximity to the legislature;[8] that said, Bowman attracted further criticism after lodging £1,601 and £13,483 in dining and hotel accommodation expenses, respectively, dating from his accession to September 2018.[15]Bowman decided not to contest the 2021 elections. On 18 March, his last speech to the legislature addressed the challenges Scottish parliamentarians faced owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, raising concerns over and urging established MSPs to ""bring new members on board in what is a much more virtual Parliament these days"".[19] He also paid tribute to his late wife, Helen, who died in October 2020 at the age of 70. Members of opposition parties congratulated his service; among them was Willie Rennie, Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who observed that ""he knows he can retire from this place knowing he did his bit for his country"".[19]
Parliamentary duties[edit]
Bowman has served as a member of the parliamentary Public Audit and Post-legislative Scrutiny Committee, as well as a substitute member of the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee.[20] These duties are combined with his position as the Scottish Conservatives' Spokesperson for Taxation, a duty he has exercised since 28 June 2017.[21][22] In this capacity, a parliamentary question tabled by Bowman to the Scottish Government in June 2018 first revealed that national business rates were taxing firms £200m more than those operating under English regulations.[23] Bowman is also a constituent of the Cross-Party parliamentary groups on Building Bridges with Israel, Culture, and Scotch Whisky, further serving as Deputy Chair of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit.[20]

^ Normally, regional MSPs do not have individual predecessors and successors. However, Johnstone died during a sitting parliament so was succeeded by Bowman.

Personal detailsBorn (1956-03-30) 30 March 1956 (age 67)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyLabour Co-operativeSpousePatricia Ferguson[1]Alma materUniversity of StirlingOccupationTeacher (English)Bill Butler (born 30 March 1956 in Glasgow) is a Scottish Labour Co-operative politician. He was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Anniesland from a by-election in 2000 (following the death of the incumbent, First Minister Donald Dewar) until losing his seat in the 2011 election.
Butler is also a committed member of CND and has voted against the party in matters concerning nuclear weapons.[2]
Early life and career[edit]
Born in Glasgow, Butler graduated from the University of Stirling and Notre Dame College of Education in Bearsden. He taught at a number of schools in Renfrewshire and in Rutherglen, including Stonelaw High School, from 1980 to 2000.

Reform of damages legislation[edit]
In June 2010, Butler launched a Member's Bill in the Scottish Parliament to reform the law on damages for wrongful death,[3] which was successful, being passed by the Parliament on 3 March 2011 with unanimous support.[4][5] The Bill was based on recommendations from the Scottish Law Commission intended to bring about fairer levels of compensation for victims of wrongful death cases (e.g. industrial accidents and disease) and their loved ones. The reforms will also mean less cases needing to go to court, which in some cases will eliminate the need for details of victims' lives to be the subject of courtroom wrangling and in all cases will mean that compensation will be paid out more speedily.

Parliamentary activity[edit]
Previously, Butler sought backing in the Scottish Parliament for a bill to make Scottish health boards part-elected. His efforts won the backing of the Health Committee and Health Minister at the time, Andy Kerr, agreed to allow the scheme to be piloted.
In August 2008 he declared himself a candidate for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament, but was not elected.
After losing his Holyrood seat, he was selected as a Labour candidate for the Greater Pollok ward in the Glasgow City Council elections in 2012[6] and topped the poll with 2,462 first preferences. In 2017 he stood for the Garscadden/Scotstounhill ward and again was elected as the leading candidate.

Anti-sectarianism[edit]
Butler has been at the forefront of the campaign to tackle sectarianism in Scotland. In June 2009 he persuaded Alex Salmond to bring before the Scottish Parliament a new strategy to tackle sectarianism.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Butler is married to Patricia Ferguson, a fellow Labour MSP and former Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport.

Wilson was born in Paisley in 1963 and attended Shawlands Academy, the University of Glasgow, University of Aberdeen, and Queen's University Belfast.[1][2] While living in Oxford, employed in conservation by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust and the University of Oxford, he became politically involved with the Labour Party. Upon returning to his native Scotland he became convinced of the case for Scottish independence and that the Labour Party's commitment to social justice was waning. In 1989 he joined the Scottish National Party (SNP).[1]
Candidature and leadership challenge[edit]
He stood unsuccessfully as an SNP candidate for the House of Commons in the Glasgow Anniesland constituency in the 1997 General Election before standing in the Glasgow Maryhill constituency in both the 1999 and 2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections. Wilson was also elected chair of the SNP's Glasgow Regional Association in 2001.
In the aftermath of the SNP's poor election performance in 2003, Wilson became convinced that a change of direction was needed by the SNP leadership. After discussing this with various SNP members, he was persuaded to contest the leadership himself and launched a challenge against the SNP leader, John Swinney.[1] His campaign focused on the issue of centralising the control of the party away from the branches and activists, and what he argued was the trend of placing the SNP ideologically in the centre ground of politics, away from the party's traditional position on the left-of-centre.
In the leadership contest that ensued at the SNP's 2003 Conference Swinney received 577 votes from those delegates voting to Wilson's 111 to remain leader. There were 17 ""positive abstentions"" (delegates present who voted in other ballots that day) and 60 non-voters. However, the following year Swinney resigned after sustained media speculation that he was unsuitable for the role. The immediate catalyst for Swinney's resignation was the SNP's poor performance in the elections to the European Parliament, although many spectators commented that Wilson's challenge also contributed to his resignation.
Shortly after the leadership contest he stood down as convenor of the SNP Glasgow Regional Association and was replaced in that position by his leadership campaign manager. Wilson stood as the SNP candidate for the Paisley and Renfrewshire North constituency for the 2005 UK general election. He finished in second place behind James Sheridan of the Labour Party.

As an MSP[edit]
At the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Wilson stood in the West Renfrewshire constituency and also on the party list for the West of Scotland region. In West Renfrewshire he came third, the SNP dropping behind the Conservatives who took second place to Labour. He was elected on the regional list and sworn in as a Member of the Scottish Parliament.
Wilson's maiden speech to the Scottish Parliament, delivered on 6 June 2007, underlined his belief in the links between crime and deprivation and his commitment to social justice.[3]His campaigns have included awareness of the negative health impact of depleted uranium on service personnel and civilians, equity fines for corporate crimes, as well as promotion of Scots language.

Joining the Scottish Greens[edit]
Following the 2017 General Election campaign Wilson left the SNP and subsequently joined the Scottish Green Party. On 28 June 2018 he was elected Co-Convener of the Edinburgh Branch of the Scottish Greens, standing down in 2019. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election he stood on the Lothian List for the Scottish Green Party as the 10th of 12 candidates.[4] The party won two seats in the region.

Before the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections Doris was set to be council candidate for the Maryhill/Kelvin ward at the Glasgow City Council elections of 2007.

As a member of the Scottish Conservatives, he was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Mid Scotland and Fife region from 1999 to 2007. Later a member of the Brexit Party, he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for North East England from 2019 to 2020.

Early life and education[edit]
Monteith was born in January 1958 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was educated at Portobello High School and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He was a member of the Federation of Conservative Students.[1] He also organised a successful campaign to take Heriot-Watt out of the National Union of Students which they subsequently rejoined.

Early career[edit]
Following university Monteith initially worked as a researcher for Thatcherite London-based think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies.
Monteith moved on to work in the public relations arena for Michael Forsyth Associates – Monteith shared a flat in London with his mentor and boss Michael Forsyth. Later Monteith set up Leith Communications public relations company in Edinburgh. The company however went bust in the early 1990s owing over £50,000 to creditors. This crisis forced Monteith to withdraw from standing for the Scottish Conservative Party against Labour's John Smith in Monklands East in the 1992 general election.
Monteith went on to be the leader of the unsuccessful Think Twice ""No-No"" campaign in the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum which opposed the creation of the Scottish Parliament.

Scottish Parliament[edit]
Monteith was elected to the Scottish Parliament as a Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party list member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region at the 1999 election.  After election to the Scottish parliament Monteith developed a reputation as a Thatcherite disciple of former Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.[2] He later argued in favour of giving more financial powers to the Scottish Parliament and wanted to move his party in a different direction ideologically and strategically.
Between 1999 and 2003 Montieth was the Conservative Party's Education, Arts, Culture & Sport spokesperson.[3] In July 2005 Monteith resigned though as the Finance Spokesperson, stating that he wanted the freedom to discuss policy matters that ""cut across other policy portfolios"". Later that year the Scottish Conservative Party withdrew the whip from Monteith when it emerged that he had been briefing the media against the then Scottish Conservative leader David McLetchie regarding questions over McLetchie's £11,500 of claims for taxi expenses.[4][5]In 2006 Monteith announced he would not stand again as an MSP, saying he ""would rather return to commerce than be a one-man band swimming against the treacly tide of collectivism in the Scottish Parliament"".[6]
European Parliament[edit]
Monteith was elected as an MEP for the Brexit Party in the North East England constituency at the 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom.[7] During the election campaign, it was revealed Monteith's candidature listed a French address as his principal place of residence on his nomination papers, a practice allowed in European Parliament elections. He later revealed that he would be relocating to the United Kingdom.[8]
Other work[edit]
Monteith is a former Chairman of English-Speaking Union Scotland and has had two stints working for the Botswanan government. Monteith is also an acquaintance of indicted American lobbyist Jack Abramoff.[9][10]Monteith is also in the course of writing a second book and writes regularly for many newspapers including a regular opinion column for the Edinburgh Evening News. He is also well known for being a supporter of Hibernian. His two sons are presently on the books of Edinburgh City.
Monteith is currently the editor of ThinkScotland.org and communications director of the lobbyists Global Britain. From December 2015 Brian Monteith was seconded to Leave.EU for the duration of the referendum campaign. He lives in the commune of Trevien in the department of Tarn in southern France.[11][12][13]

Brian Ian Whittle (born 26 April 1964)[1] is a Scottish politician and former athlete, who has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South Scotland region since 2016. A member of the Scottish Conservatives, he serves as Shadow Minister for Environment, Biodiversity and Land Reform.
Whittle won the gold medal in the 4 x 400 metres relay at both the 1986 European Athletics Championships and 1994 European Athletics Championships. He also competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

Early life[edit]
Whittle was born in 1964 growing up in the Scottish town of Troon. His father was a sprinter until his late teens. Whilst at school, Brian tried a wide range of sports, enjoying many of them but it was apparent that he had a natural talent for running. He has maintained that his talent lay in his discipline and ability to train.
Brian Whittle was educated at Marr College in Troon and went on to read Chemistry at The University of Glasgow and Kilmarnock College.

Athletic career[edit]
At club level, Whittle ran for both Ayr Seaforth and Enfield & Haringey. His best performance in the 400 m was 45.22 at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.[2] He finished 1st in his heat, 3rd in the quarter-final, but did not progress past the semi-final. He ran 45.5 on the first leg of the 4 × 400 m relay (team – Whittle, Kriss Akabusi, Todd Bennett, Phil Brown), but for once the GB team performed below par and finished fifth in the Olympic final.  Perhaps his greatest achievement, and what he is best remembered for, is the manner in which he helped Great Britain win the gold medal in the 4 x 400 metres relay at the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart. He ran the third leg of the race with one shoe, running a personal best leg time of 45.09. As he took the baton from Kriss Akabusi, Akabusi stood on his shoe and it ripped off, leaving him to run the race without it (thereafter the press nicknamed him 'One-shoe Whittle'). The other members of the team were Roger Black and Derek Redmond, all of whom ran Personal Best times on the day.
Whittle also won a relay gold medal in the 1994 European Athletics Championships 4 × 400 metres relay team alongside David McKenzie, Roger Black, and Du'aine Ladejo. He also ran in the heats of the 4 × 400 m relay at the 1990 European Championships in Split.
He moved to 800 m after the 1988 Olympic Games, and ran in the final of the 1990 Commonwealth Games 800 m in New Zealand, where he finished fourth ahead of Sebastian Coe and Tom McKean. Whittle ran the last leg of the Commonwealth Games 4 × 400 m in 1990, anchoring the Scottish Team to a silver medal. He ran 44.7 seconds for his leg.
He also ran the 800 m in the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo. His personal best for 800 m was 1:45.47 in 1990.
Other notable performances included running 45.98 at the 1988 European Indoor Championships in Budapest winning the silver medal – a feat he repeated in 1989. He ran the last leg of the winning 4 × 400 m relay in the Europa Cup in 1989 (Gateshead), helping Great Britain to win the team title for the first time.
Whittle was an international schools' high jumper, and also competed in the 200m at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, making the semi-final.

Political career[edit]
Whittle contested the 2015 UK general election in the constituency of Kilmarnock and Loudoun for the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, coming 3rd with 12.5% of the vote.
At the 2016 elections to the Scottish Parliament, he was elected for the South Scotland region.[3]
Controversy[edit]
Whittle sparked a row over the two-child cap on tax credits by claiming “there is no such thing as a rape clause”, claiming it was impossible to debate the controversial welfare reform as “the term rape clause is an invention to beat the Tories with”. The remarks were widely condemned and described as “skin-crawling” by other parties.[4]
Personal life[edit]
Whittle has three daughters.[5]

Crawford served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Stirling from 2007 to 2021, having previously represented the Mid Scotland and Fife region 1999–2007.

Early life and career[edit]
Cameron Roy Marchand Buchanan was born on 17 September 1946 in Woking, Surrey.[1] After studying at St Edward's School, Oxford and Sorbonne University,[2] Buchanan worked as a textile entrepreneur and was managing director of woollen goods retailer Harrisons of Edinburgh prior to taking his seat.[3]

Personal detailsBorn (1960-03-10) 10 March 1960 (age 63)Political partyScottish National PartyOther politicalaffiliationsIndependent (July 2004 – April 2007)Campbell Martin (born 10 March 1960) is a Scottish journalist and former politician.
At the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, he was elected on the Scottish National Party (SNP) list as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland. He was expelled from the SNP in 2004, and sat as an independent MSP until the 2007 election, when he stood in the Cunninghame North constituency but not the West of Scotland region. He was not re-elected.

Political career[edit]
Martin previously worked for Kay Ullrich, a SNP MSP. When she indicated she would stand down at the 2003 election, Martin was selected to be the candidate for Cunninghame North as well as being placed at the top of the SNP's list.[1] At the election, he was unsuccessful in the constituency vote,[2] however, was elected as a regional member for the West of Scotland.[3]He was a prominent backer of Dr Bill Wilson who stood against John Swinney in the SNP leadership contest in 2003.[4]  He has been critical of the direction of the SNP since becoming an MSP, believing they are being dragged into the political centre away from their traditional left-of-centre position. He also believes the party is not vociferous enough in its advocation of Scottish independence.
He was suspended from the Scottish National Party on 25 April 2004 after making repeated public criticism of John Swinney,[5] and was expelled from the SNP on 10 July 2004, soon after Swinney had resigned.[6]After becoming an Independent MSP, Campbell Martin played a prominent role in fighting a number of decisions taken by Labour-led North Ayrshire Council.  He has also continued his opposition to what he considers to be the centre-right re-positioning of the SNP and its advocacy of a 'culture of independence' rather than national independence.
Campbell Martin stood as an Independent candidate in the Cunninghame North constituency at the May 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, securing 4,423 votes (14.6%), but was not re-elected.[7]In August 2011 he joined the Scottish Socialist Party,[8] and on 1 October 2011 he spoke at an SSP fringe meeting in Glasgow following the STUC anti-cuts demonstration.  He participated as a delegate at the SSP national conference in March 2012. He was the SSP candidate for the Ardrossan and Arran ward on North Ayrshire Council in May 2012, but he was not elected.[9][10]He has claimed that the SNP has been infiltrated by MI5 agents. Writing in pro-independence website BarrheadBoy, Martin said: ""The SNP is completely compromised. It has been captured and controlled by the British state. The difference between those early days of the Scottish parliament and today, is that the British state assets in the SNP have, over the intervening years, risen through the ranks and now hold senior positions that have allowed them to influence party policies and direction, such as adopting a lack of urgency in delivering independence."" He justified his claim by pointing out that intelligence services had previously infiltrated organisations like the Irish Republican Army and the National Union of Minerworkers.[11]
Journalism[edit]
Between 2007 and 2015, Campbell Martin edited  the3towns.com[12] an online local newspaper covering the three North Ayrshire towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston. He is now the Creative Director of MacAulay Gibson Productions, an independent production company producing factual television programmes and business promos.[13] He was involved in the production of The Only Game in Town, a documentary that looked at the procurement process for the North Ayrshire Schools Public Private Partnership project.[14]While still producing pro-independence articles for mainly online publications, Campbell Martin is no longer a member of a political party.

Books[edit]
Campbell Martin's autobiography – Was It Something I Said? (ISBN 979-8-7560-8982-0) – was published in October 2021.[15]
A two-book series by Campbell Martin – Outspoken – Part One (ISBN 979-8-3625-5801-7)[16]  and Outspoken – Part Two (ISBN 979-8-3625-6790-3)[17] – covering Scottish politics, society and international affairs over the past ten years (2013–2023) were re-published in July 2023.References[edit]

Personal detailsBorn1975 (age 48–49)NationalityScottishPolitical partyScottish LabourOther politicalaffiliationsCampaign for SocialismSpouseSimonRelationsCathy Peattie (mother)Children3ResidenceDunfermlineCara Laura Hilton (born 1975) is a Scottish Labour politician, who was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Dunfermline from 2013 to 2016.[1]
Political career[edit]
Hilton was the Labour candidate at the Dunfermline by-election on 20 October 2013. She won by a majority of more than 2,800 votes, overturning a previous SNP majority of 590. This was the first time ever that Labour had won a parliamentary seat (in either the UK or Scottish parliaments) from the SNP at a by-election.
In her victory speech, Hilton praised the courage of preceding MSP Bill Walker's ex-wives. Walker's conviction for assault against his former wives had led to his resignation from parliament, causing the by-election.[2]Alex Salmond accused her of running a dishonest campaign, including the circulation of a leaflet criticised by the SNP as ""demonstrably untrue"".[3]In the Scottish Parliament election of 2016, Hilton lost her seat to the SNP's Shirley-Anne Somerville, who she had previously defeated at the by-election three years earlier. Along with the loss of the neighbouring Cowdenbeath constituency, this left the Labour Party without parliamentary representation in Fife for the first time since 1910.
Hilton was the Labour Party candidate for Dumfermline and West Fife in the 2017 and 2019 general elections, but both times came second behind the incumbent SNP MP Douglas Chapman.[4]Hilton served as vice-chair of Scottish Labour from 2019 to 2020, and has served as chair of Scottish Labour since 2020.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Hilton is the daughter of former Labour MSP and Scottish Labour chair Cathy Peattie.[6] Her husband is Simon, and she has three children.

Personal detailsBorn (1965-03-05) 5 March 1965 (age 58)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Socialist PartyChildren2 daughtersAlma materUniversity of StrathclydeUniversity of DundeeProfessionformer midwife, lawyerCarolyn Leckie (born 5 March 1965) is a Scottish politician.  She was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP), and held a number of senior positions in the party, but has since left the SSP.[1]  From 2003 to 2007 she was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Central Scotland region, having been elected on the SSP list.

Biography[edit]
Leckie was born on 5 March 1965[2] and grew up in Glasgow, the daughter of a shipyard worker.[3] She now lives in East Kilbride. Before she became an MSP she was a midwife and a local union leader who represented thousands of hospital workers in Glasgow.[4]
Campaigning[edit]
Just before election to Holyrood, she led several victorious strikes against low pay - the most recent involving 300 ancillary workers against the French multinational, Sodexho. As an MSP she was a strong supporter of the Nursery Nurses campaigning for higher pay. On 20 May 2004, after attempting to raise a point of order about the strike at a time that the Presiding Officer determined was inappropriate, she was told to leave the chamber.[5] She was active within the parliament campaigning for an end to the cuts and closures in hospital services across Scotland.
On 20 January 2005, she was jailed for seven days for non-payment of a fine, arising from a protest outside Faslane nuclear base.[6] The Nursing and Midwifery Council did not consider it an impediment to her registration as a Midwife.[7] In January 2007, she was arrested but not charged for taking part in an anti-nuclear demonstration at Faslane as part of the Faslane 365 campaign.
In April 2014, Leckie led a campaign against plans to demolish the Red Road Flats during the 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony.[8]
Other information[edit]
Leckie was co-chair of the Scottish Socialist Party for several years. She stood down at the March 2006 annual conference, stating that it was time to hand the post over to a lay member of the party, but she was easily elected as an ordinary member of its executive committee.
She was one of several members who gave evidence in the Sheridan v News International defamation action, and the subsequent criminal trial HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan. Former SSP leader Tommy Sheridan was found guilty of perjury and sentenced to three years in prison.[9][10]At the SSP conference in 2008, Leckie declined nomination for any national posts within the party, but remained an activist within the party, particularly within the Socialist Women's Network. She drifted away from the party and stopped paying subscriptions without it being noticed.[1]Leckie is a founder member of Women for Independence campaign for Scottish independence.[11][12][13]Leckie worked for a Women's Aid group from 2007 to 2014. She completed an LLB at the University of Strathclyde[2] in 2014, continuing to work throughout. She has since gained a Diploma in Professional Legal Practice from the University of Dundee and is pursuing a law career. She has stated that she will not stand for election again.

Personal detailsBornCatherine Mary Jamieson (1956-11-03) 3 November 1956 (age 67)Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Labour and Co-operative PartyAlma materGlasgow School of ArtGoldsmiths College University of GlasgowGlasgow Caledonian UniversityWebsitewww.cathyjamieson.comCatherine Mary Jamieson (born 3 November 1956) is a Scottish business director, currently a director at Kilmarnock Football Club and former politician. She served as the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland from 2000 to 2008. She previously served in the Scottish Executive as Minister for Justice from 2003 to 2007 and Minister for Education and Young People from 2001 to 2003. Jamieson was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley from 1999 to 2011 and was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Kilmarnock and Loudoun from 2010 to 2015.
Born in Kilmarnock, Jamieson was educated at James Hamilton Academy and later studied Fine Art at the Glasgow School of Art, before gaining a Higher National Diploma in Art at Goldsmiths College in London. She trained as an art therapist, but decided to take a career in social work. In 1983, Jamieson gained a Certificate of Qualification in Social Work from the University of Glasgow. After graduating, she worked in various posts within the Strathclyde Regional Council and worked for Who Cares? Scotland from 1992 to 1999. Jamieson stood as a Labour candidate in the 1999 election to the 1st Scottish Parliament. After a successful campaign, she was elected to represent the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. As a backbencher, Jamieson various Scottish Parliament committees and was the deputy convenor of the European Committee. Following the death of Donald Dewar, Henry McLeish was elected Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland and Jamieson was elected unopposed as his deputy leader, the first officeholder. In the aftermath of McLeish's resignation, she served as the acting Leader until Jack McConnell was elected as the new Labour leader.
Following McConnell's appointment as First Minister of Scotland in 2001, Jamieson was appointed to the Scottish Cabinet to serve as the Minister for Education and Young People. As the Education Minister, she conducted a reform of the Scottish Qualifications Authority and successfully passed the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001 through the parliament, which sought to set up a list of people unsuitable to work with children, maintained by Disclosure Scotland. In the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Jamieson was re-elected and was appointed the Minister for Justice in McConnell's second cabinet reshuffle. As the Justice Minister, she took a leading role on anti-social behaviour, tackling violence and sectarianism and commissioned a major review of Scotland's Civil Justice system. Jamieson made attempts to ban Buckfast, a popular drink among underage drinkers, however, she was unsuccessful as the company threatened to take legal action against the Scottish Executive. In early 2005, it was revealed her nephew, Derek Hyslop, tried to blackmail her. In 1999, Jamieson sent £100 to Hyslop following the birth of his son, but he claimed it was sent to help him evade the police while he was on the run.
At the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the Scottish Labour Party were defeated by the Scottish National Party (SNP), by just a single seat; ending eight years of Labour-Lib Dem devolved governance in Scotland. McConnell announced his resignation as the Leader of Scottish Labour and Jamieson served as acting leader until Wendy Alexander was elected. Jamieson continued to serve as the Deputy Leader until she resigned in June 2008 to stand for election as the Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland following Alexander's resignation. She came second, having been defeated by Iain Gray. Jamieson was appointed by Gray as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing. Jamieson stood down as an MSP in the 2011 election and ran as a candidate at the 2010 UK general election. She was elected to the House of Commons, representing the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency. Under Ed Miliband, Jamieson was appointed in 2011 as the Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury within the Official Opposition frontbench. At the 2015 general election, she was defeated by the SNP candidate Alan Brown, at what was a landslide defeat for Scottish Labour after 51 years of domination of Scottish politics at Westminster.
Since leaving Parliament, Jamieson became CEO of CareVisions Ltd. In May 2018, she was appointed to the Kilmarnock Football Club board of directors.

Early life[edit]
Education[edit]
Catherine Mary Jamieson was born on 3 November 1956 in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire.[1] Jamieson was educated at James Hamilton Academy, before obtaining a BA (Hons) in Fine Art at the Glasgow School of Art and a Higher National Diploma in Art at Goldsmiths College in London. She gained a Management qualification from the Glasgow Caledonian University and later a post graduate Certificate of Qualification in social work from the University of Glasgow.[2]
Early career[edit]
After training as an art therapist, Jamieson turned to social work, becoming principal officer of an advocacy organisation for young people in care. She was also a member of the Edinburgh inquiry into abuse in residential care and served on the management and advisory committees of several childcare agencies.

Early political career[edit]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
Jamieson was elected an MSP in the first 1999 Scottish Parliament election. She was elected Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2000 in leadership elections following the death of First Minister, Donald Dewar. The position of Deputy Leader was a first for the Scottish party, and Jamieson was elected unopposed.[3]
Minister for Education and Young People: 2001–2003[edit]
In 2001, Jack McConnell became First Minister and Jamieson was appointed Minister for Education and Young People in the subsequent cabinet reshuffle.[4] She successfully shepherded the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001[5] through parliament – legislation which set up a list of people unsuitable to work with children,[6] to be maintained by Disclosure Scotland.[7]During her tenure as education minister, Jamieson reformed the Scottish Qualifications Authority to reduce bureaucracy,[8] and commenced the largest school building programme seen in Scotland.[9] During the UK-wide fire strike in 2002, Jamieson was criticised for refusing to publicly endorse the Executive's collectively agreed description of the fire strike as ""unacceptable"", and opposition MSPs called for her to be sacked. However, the First Minister issued a statement of public support for Jamieson and took no action.[10]
Minister for Justice: 2003–2007[edit]
Jamieson was appointed Minister for Justice following the 2003 Scottish Parliament election.[11] During her tenure, in addition to taking a substantial justice legislative programme through parliament (14 bills including reform of courts, protections for vulnerable witnesses, measures on the management of offenders, policing, family law, legal aid, the legal profession and the establishment of the Scottish Commission on Human Rights) she took a leading role on anti-social behaviour, tackling violence and sectarianism and commissioned a major review of Scotland's Civil Justice system.
In February 2005, it was revealed that Jamieson's nephew, Derek Hyslop, tried to blackmail her in 2001 while she was Education Minister. Hyslop was serving a jail sentence for manslaughter, and sent her a Christmas card demanding money, threatening to reveal his criminal convictions if she did not pay him.[12] Jamieson had paid £100 into his bank account in 1999, following the birth of his son, and Hyslop tried to claim that she made the payment to help him evade the police while he was on the run.[13]One of the major crises to face Jamieson during her time as Minister for Justice, was the scandals occurring after the transfer of prisoner escort duties from the police to a private company, Reliance Security Group. Four days following the transfer, Reliance accidentally released a convicted killer at Hamilton Sheriff Court.[14] Jamieson later criticised Reliance and their security methods, but defended the principle of using a private company to transfer prisoners.[15] Opposition parties later called for her to resign, calls that Jamieson rejected, stating ""I think the responsibility on a minister is to ensure that problems are solved... Some people in the face of problems might turn away, might walk away from them. I have no intention of doing that and I never did.""[16]One of the more high-profile campaigns launched by Jamieson was a campaign to ban Buckfast, a tonic wine popular with some underage drinkers in parts of Scotland. She campaigned against shops in her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency to limit sales of the drink, claiming it was ""linked to anti-social behaviour among young people"". The distributors of Buckfast later threatened legal action against the Minister, stating it was harming sales,[17] although the reported effect was that Buckfast sales had actually increased substantially in the months following her comments.[18] On a subsequent visit to Auchinleck, a town within her constituency, she faced an impromptu demonstration by teenagers chanting ""Don't ban Buckie"".[19]  In 2005, she co-introduced the joint Scottish Executive and Home Office consultation on criminalising possession of ""extreme pornography"", which claimed the intention ""to reduce the demand for such material and to send a clear message that it has no place in our society"".[20] She referred to such material as ""abhorrent"".[21] The plans have been opposed by groups such as the umbrella group Backlash.

Out of power: 2007[edit]
Following the Scottish National Party (SNP) victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Jamieson was appointed Shadow Minister for Parliamentary Business[22] and was selected as Labour's appointment to the Parliamentary Bureau.
After Jack McConnell's resignation as Scottish Labour Leader on 15 August, Jamieson was acting leader until 14 September 2007, when Wendy Alexander took over the leadership who appointed Jamieson as her deputy but without a portfolio spokesperson's role.[23]
2008 Scottish Labour Party leadership election[edit]
On 29 July 2008, Jamieson announced her intention to stand for the Scottish Labour leadership. After the contest with candidates Iain Gray and Andy Kerr, Jamieson came second to Gray during the election night on 13 September 2008.[24][25] On 16 September, Gray announced the appointment of Jamieson as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing.[26]
MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun: 2010–2015[edit]
Jamieson was elected MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun in the 2010 general election, after winning with a majority of 12,378 and 52.5% of the vote.[27] An opponent of the Trident nuclear weapons system, Jamieson became secretary of the Westminster Parliamentary CND group.[28] Following her election to the House of Commons, she did not seek re-election for her Scottish Parliament seat in the 2011 election.
Before the 2010 election, Jamieson had faced the announcement from Diageo in 2009 to pull historic links with Kilmarnock, announcing they would be moving the Johnnie Walker company to Fife, ending the 189-year link the brand had with the town.[29] She strongly criticised Alex Salmond's SNP government and its candidate for Kilmarnock and Loudoun after they announced no money would be coming from the SNP to help create new jobs in Kilmarnock. She said the announcement was a ""huge blow for the local area"" and worked with a local taskforce to put pressure on the SNP.[30]Under Ed Miliband, Jamieson was appointed in 2011 as the Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury within the Official Opposition frontbench. On being appointed, Jamieson said:

I am pleased to be joining the Shadow Treasury team. Every day we hear more about how people across the country are facing rising costs of living, and the fear of unemployment. We know that the Tory-led Government is cutting too far and too fast, and while their plan is hurting, it simply isn’t working. Labour believes there is a better way to deal with the economy, and we’ve launched our 5 point plan for jobs and growth.[31]In March 2012, two years after Jamieson became MP, the Johnnie Walker factory in Kilmarnock closed, resulting in the loss of more than 700 jobs. Jamieson described it as an ""end of an era in Kilmarnock"" and pledged to put pressure on Diageo to honour commitments for the ""iconic"" site to become a point of regrowth in Kilmarnock.[32]At the 2015 general election, Kilmarnock and Loudoun was gained by SNP candidate Alan Brown with a majority of 13,638 and 55.7% of the vote, an increase of 29.7%.[33]
After politics[edit]
Care Vision[edit]
Since leaving public office, Jamieson has been appointed as the CEO of Care Vision Children's Services. She has since committed much of her time to social work, with Care Vision providing residential and foster placements for vulnerable children and young people in Scotland.[34]
Kilmarnock Football Club[edit]
Jamieson joined the board of directors at Kilmarnock Football Club as a director following the Kilmarnock Supporters Society Ltd (The Killie Trust) reaching their £100,000 funding target through the Trust in Killie initiative. This funding allowed Jamieson to take up the position of director on the board of management. Jamieson herself is a lifelong fan of the club.[35]
Personal life[edit]
Jamieson currently lives in Mauchline with her husband, Ian Sharpe.[36] She has one son and has been a vegan since 1996.[37][38] After losing her seat, she became CEO of CareVisions Ltd, a residential child care company in Scotland originating in Dumfries and Galloway. In May 2018, she was appointed to the Kilmarnock Football Club board of directors.[39]

He was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Cathcart from 2005 to 2011.

Political career[edit]
Born in Glasgow, Gordon was educated at St Mungo's Academy in the East End of the city. He entered politics as a member of the Trotskyist International Marxist Group (IMG), but left that organisation in 1974 to join the Scottish Workers' Republican Party (SWRP), a small far-left grouping that advocated the establishment of a Scottish socialist republic. Gordon contributed to the party's journal, Scottish Worker,  and was influential in its decision to seek affiliation with the Fourth International, which led to a split within its ranks.[1]In 1976, the leaders of the SWRP joined Jim Sillars' fledgling Scottish Labour Party (SLP) en masse, ostensibly with the intention of recruiting followers and kicking out IMG 'entrists' within the new party.[1] Although the ex-SWRP contingent were distrusted by Sillars for their alleged Trotskyist sympathies, they soon assumed positions of responsibility.[2] Gordon himself became chair of the party's Glasgow West branch, and stood as the SLP candidate in Knightswood ward at the 1977 Glasgow District Council election, where he came second from bottom with 222 votes.[3][4]After the SLP was disbanded in 1981, Gordon – like many of the party's activists – chose to join the Labour Party. He was elected to represent the Drumry/Summerhill division on Strathclyde Regional Council in 1987 and remained a councillor until 1996, when the council was abolished. He was President of the P.O.L.I.S. Network (Promoting Operational Links for Integrated Services) of European Cities and Regions applying information technology to transport, from 1992 to 1995.
In 1995, he was elected to the new Glasgow City Council where he was Roads Convenor. He was Chair of the new Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority from 1996 to 1999 and was elected Deputy Leader of Glasgow City Council in 1997. In 1999, he became Leader of Glasgow City Council, an office which he held until 2005.[5] As Leader of Glasgow City Council he announced a project to regenerate the Clyde waterfront.
In 2005, following the resignation of Mike Watson as the MSP for Glasgow Cathcart, Gordon was selected as the candidate and on 29 September 2005 won the by-election by 2,405 votes from the Scottish National Party (SNP) candidate Maire Whitehead.[6] In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, he lost his seat by 1,592 votes to SNP candidate James Dornan.
Gordon is also a trade unionist, starting off in the Woodworkers' Union before becoming a branch and district official in the National Union of Railwaymen (later the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers or RMT). He is a former President of Glasgow Trades Council and is currently a member of the GMB union.

Family[edit]
Gordon has two adult sons from his first marriage and a son, Calum, with his second wife, Emma.[7]

He served as a Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South Scotland region from 2011 until 2016. 
Before joining the SNP in 2010, Brodie had been an active member of the Liberal Party and then the Liberal Democrats from the 1970s. He stood as a Liberal Democrat candidate at the 1992, 1997 and 2001 UK general elections, and as a Liberal at the general elections of October 1974, 1979, 1983 and 1987.[1][2] Brodie was latterly the co-founder and leader of political party Scotia Future from 2020 until his death in 2022. 

Early life and education[edit]
Brodie was born in Dundee on 8 May 1944.[3] He was educated at Morgan Academy in Dundee and graduated from the University of St Andrews in 1966 with a BSc in Mathematics and Economics.

Politics[edit]
Brodie first sought election to Parliament as a Liberal candidate in the October 1974 UK general election, standing in Dundee East. He contested that seat again in 1979. He had been selected to contest Glasgow Hillhead for the Liberal Party at the next election; a seat the party was campaigning actively in. However, at the start of 1982, the incumbent Conservative MP Tam Galbraith died, triggering a by-election. The fledgling SDP, who had created an electoral pact - termed the 'Alliance' - with the Liberals immediately declaring they wished to fight the seat and wanted former Cabinet minister Roy Jenkins to be their candidate.[4] Critical of the fact that the SDP and Liberals were 'haggling only hours' after Galbraith had died, Brodie initially declined to comment on the situation, other than to indicate he would act in the best interests of the Alliance.[4] Ultimately after talks with Jenkins in London, Brodie agreed to withdraw in his favour.[5] Jenkins would go on to win the by-election.
Following the merger of the Liberals and the SDP, he then contested Ayr in 1983 and North West Surrey in 1987. Brodie stood as a Liberal Democrat/SDP candidate in Surrey Heath's Old Dean ward at the 1987 local election, finishing third with 475 votes.[6] At the 1991 local election, he then stood in Surrey Heath's Bisley and Heatherside wards, finishing second and fourth respectively with 363 votes in Bisley and 879 votes in Heatherside.[6] He fought Glasgow Garscadden as a Liberal Democrat at the 1992 general election, finishing in fourth place in the seat held by then-Shadow Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar.[2] Brodie was eventually elected in Surrey Heath's Parkside ward at the 1995 local election, coming second with 628 votes.[6]Brodie stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Perth at the 1997 general election. At the 2001 general election, Brodie stood for the Liberal Democrats at Greenock and Inverclyde, finishing second with 5,039 votes. He then joined the Scottish National Party in 2010, first standing for them at the 2010 general election for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock, where he finished in third place; moving ahead of the Liberal Democrats who took fourth.

Scottish Parliament[edit]
Brodie was an SNP candidate in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. He was not successful in the constituency vote for Ayr, but was returned on the regional list as an MSP for South Scotland.
At Parliament, he was a deputy convener of the Public Petitions committee and a member of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee and the Subordinate Legislation Committee (see Committees of the Scottish Parliament).[7] He was also Convener of the Cross-Party Group on Social Enterprise, and a member of the groups on China, Golf and Nuclear Disarmament.
From 2013 to 2014, Brodie claimed £54,297 in expenses, the highest amount for a MSP that session.[8]In August 2015, he failed to win selection as the SNP candidate for the Ayr constituency, losing out to Glasgow councillor Jennifer Dunn.[9] In October 2015, he was included on the SNP's regional list for South Scotland, placed seventh.[10] The SNP returned three MSPs from their list.[11]
Controversies[edit]
In March 2016, questions were raised about Brodie's Parliamentary expenses. Over the five years that he had been a MSP, he paid a total of £87,616 for ""outsourced constituency work"" to Caledonii Resources, a company set up in 2010.[12] That company was 90% owned by Corri Wilson, who founded it one month before she became an SNP councillor for Ayr East ward in 2012.[13] Some £20,000 was transferred during the Scottish independence referendum campaign in 2014 and a further £20,000 being transferred during the 2015 UK general election campaign.[14][15]
Independent candidate[edit]
In January 2017, Brodie resigned from the SNP and announced that he would stand as an Independent candidate in the Ayr West ward of South Ayrshire as part of the 2017 Council election.[16] At the election, he secured 506 first preference votes, finishing last behind six other candidates.

Scotia Future[edit]
In 2020, Brodie announced that he would be founding a new party, Scotia Future, and would stand at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[17]Brodie contested the constituency seat of  Ayr in the election, but was unsuccessful, getting only 267 votes (0.6%). 
He also stood as the party’s candidate for the  South Scotland Region, but was not elected.

Personal life and death[edit]
Brodie died after a short battle with oesophageal cancer on 24 September 2022, at the age of 78.[18][19] Following his death, various Scottish political figures, including Deputy First Minister John Swinney who described Brodie as a ""lovely colleague and friend"".[19]

Personal detailsBornChristine Grahame (1944-09-09) 9 September 1944 (age 79)Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, EnglandPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materUniversity of EdinburghOccupationSolicitorWebsitewww.christinegrahame.comChristine Grahame (formerly Creech; born 9 September 1944) is a Scottish politician who served as a Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2016 to 2021. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale constituency since 2011, having previously represented the South of Scotland region from 1999 to 2011.
Born in Staffordshire, England, and raised in Edinburgh, Scotland, she attended the University of Edinburgh and Moray House College of Education. After graduating, Grahame worked as an English teacher in secondary schools. In 1984, she graduated from the Edinburgh University again, but this time with a Bachelor of Laws degree. After gaining Diploma in Legal Practice she worked as a solicitor. Grahame was the SNP's candidate for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale in the 1992 UK General election, but failed to win the seat. In 1999, she ran for equivalent constituency in the new Scottish Parliament. Although she was unsuccessful, she was elected as an additional member of the South of Scotland region.
Grahame ran for Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party in the 2004 leadership election, but was defeated by Nicola Sturgeon. In 2011, she was elected MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale. Following the 2016 election to the 5th Scottish Parliament, Grahame was elected Deputy Presiding Officer. She held the position alongside Linda Fabiani from 2016 until 2021. She has served on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body since May 2021.[1]
Early life and education[edit]
Christine Grahame was born on 9 September 1944 in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, to a Scottish father and English mother. Her maternal grandfather was Welsh.[2] Grahame was brought up in Edinburgh, attending Boroughmuir High School.
She attained a Scottish Master of Arts degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1965 and gained her Diploma of Education from Moray House College of Education in 1966. After graduating, Grahame worked as a secondary teacher of English in a number of schools in Fife and Dumfries and Galloway.[3]After a period as a housewife, she returned to Edinburgh University as a mature student where she earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1984 and a Diploma in Legal Practice in 1985, subsequently practising as a solicitor at a number of law firms until her election as an MSP in 1999.[3]
Political career[edit]
Christine Grahame's office in GalashielsGrahame joined the Scottish National Party in 1970. Using her married name, Christine Creech, she was the SNP candidate at the 1992 General Election for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. In the 1994 European Parliament election, she contested the South of Scotland constituency, again unsuccessfully. At the 1999 Scottish Parliament election she ran for the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale constituency.

Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Although she finished second in the constituency vote, she was elected on the SNP's South of Scotland regional list. She later divorced and reverted to her maiden name. She contested Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale at the 2003 and 2007 elections, coming within 1,000 votes of victory on both occasions and being subsequently elected on the regional South of Scotland list.[4] From 2001 to 2003, she was Convener of the Justice Committee.
In 2004, Grahame ran as a candidate for deputy leadership of the SNP after deputy leader Roseanna Cunningham entered the contest to replace leader John Swinney. She was defeated by Nicola Sturgeon. After the election, she was reshuffled from chair of the Scottish Parliament's Health committee to Shadow Minister for Social Justice, generally seen by media commentators as an upwards shift. In June 2005, she was elected Honorary President of the Federation of Student Nationalists.[citation needed]In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Grahame won the redrawn seat of Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, defeating former Liberal Democrat finance spokesman Jeremy Purvis.[5] Following her election, she was again selected as Convener of the Justice Committee for the session.

Deputy Presiding Officer[edit]
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Grahame held the seat, increasing her share of the vote to 45.1%. Following the 2016 election, she was elected as Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, serving alongside Linda Fabiani MSP.[6] Grahame was also re-elected as Convener of the Cross Party Group on Animal Welfare.[7] During the COVID-19 pandemic, she went into self isolation as someone over 70 years old and therefore at more risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.[8] In April 2020, Scottish Labour's Lewis Macdonald was elected as interim Deputy Presiding Officer in her absence.[9]
Return to backbenches[edit]
In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election Grahame was re-elected as an MSP. She has served on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body since May 2021.[1]
Causes[edit]
Since entering the Scottish Parliament in 1999 Grahame has picked up a number of causes, notably;
Borders Railway
For more information see: Borders Railway
One of Grahame's first actions as an MSP in 1999 was to set up a Cross Party Group to support the work of public petitions on the re-establishment of the Borders Railway[10] which had been closed in 1969 during the controversial Beeching cuts. She continued to campaign for this for a number of years, with the line eventually opening between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in 2015.
Grahame has named her continued support of this as one of her biggest achievements[11] and said on its opening ""As someone who has campaigned for the return of the Waverley Line since 1999, it was an absolute privilege to be have finally traveled the length of the journey by rail, and to appreciate our wonderful countryside from a new perspective. So far this project has been an overwhelming success... If my experience is anything to go by, this will undoubtedly bring many, many visitors to Midlothian and the Borders as well as encouraging people to stay and live in the area.""[12]Great Tapestry of Scotland
In late 2015 Grahame became involved in a public dispute with Scottish Borders Council over the siting of the Great Tapestry of Scotland in the constituency.[13] Councillors had approved a £6m purpose built visitor centre at Tweedbank Railway Station, however Grahame contested that the business case was flawed and persuaded Scottish Government ministers to investigate this further before releasing the funding required to create it.[14] Grahame favoured siting the tapestry in a disused building in Galashiels arguing that that option had more potential to regenerate the area and encourage tourists to access transport links from Galashiels to the wider region.[15]In June 2016 one councillor resigned from the SNP over Grahame's intervention, claiming it represented a ""lack of support"" for SNP councillors and that he had not voted for her in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.[16]However, Grahame's position was eventually vindicated, with the council recommending Galashiels as the preferred site in December 2016 stating ""Galashiels offers the greatest potential to provide a world class attraction which will make a significant contribution to the Borders economy.""[17]Lockerbie Bombing
Grahame has been outspoken in her view that the conviction of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing is unsafe and represents a miscarriage of justice.[18] In May 2009, Grahame visited Megrahi, in Greenock jail. After her visit, she told the press: ""I found it quite upsetting. The man is obviously very ill and he is desperate to see his family – absolutely desperate to see his family – so, whatever it takes, that's the priority. He did tell me things I can't discuss with you. But I am absolutely more convinced than ever that there has been a miscarriage of justice.""[19] A month later, Grahame arranged a second meeting with the prisoner, Megrahi.[20]A few days after the dropping of Megrahi's appeal against conviction and his release on compassionate grounds on 20 August 2009, Grahame wrote an op-ed article for The Independent saying she is convinced of his innocence: ""He is not a saint, of course – he had a history with Libyan intelligence – but his hands are clean over Lockerbie.""[21]Grahame has lodged several questions and motions on this in the Scottish Parliament[22] and continues to be involved with campaign groups on the matter.
Republicanism
Grahame is a supporter of the political organisation Republic, a campaign to replace the British Monarchy with an elected head of state.[23] In July 2009, Grahame snubbed Elizabeth II by checking her e-mails rather than attending the royal speech at Holyrood to mark the tenth anniversary of Scottish devolution. The move drew some criticism from commentators and fellow MSPs, however on the BBC Radio Good Morning Scotland programme, Grahame stated: ""I'm earning and working for my constituents far more than if I sit hypocritically in the chamber watching a monarch for an institution I do not support.""[24]
Personal life[edit]
Grahame has two sons and is a grandmother.[25] She has stated previously she has a harmless neurological tremor, which is hereditary and can cause visible shaking.[26]

However, she was successfully returned to the Scottish Parliament as 2nd on Labour's Mid Scotland and Fife regional list.
In the Holyrood election of 2016, Baker unsuccessfully stood in the Kirkcaldy constituency and was defeated by David Torrance of the Scottish National Party, suffering a swing against Labour of 15.8%.

She later served on the Scottish Labour front bench as spokesperson for Rural Affairs and Environment (2011–2014),[5] Culture, Europe and External Affairs (2014–2015),[6] and Democracy (covering ""constitution, Europe, culture and power in society"") (2015–2016).[7] Having served as Scottish Labour's spokesperson on Justice, Baker is currently Shadow Secretary for Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs.[8]Baker nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[9]

Personal detailsBorn (1951-10-17) 17 October 1951 (age 72)Forfar,[1] ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyWebsitewww.colinbeattiemsp.orgColin Beattie (born 17 October 1951)[2] is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Midlothian North and Musselburgh constituency since 2011. Prior to this role, he was a councillor and group leader of the SNP on Midlothian Council.

Early career[edit]
For 23 years, Beattie worked as an international banker across the Middle East and Asia. He then decided after a period of working in London that he would return to living in Scotland with his wife, Lisa.[citation needed]
Political career[edit]
Beattie took an early retirement in 2006 to focus on being elected to Midlothian Council.[3] He was elected to represent Midlothian South in the 2007 Midlothian Council election[4] and was SNP group leader on the council.[2]Beattie won the newly created seat of Midlothian North and Musselburgh in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election with a majority of just under 3000 votes.[2][5] He retained his seat in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, with a majority of over 7,000 votes.[6] He was also the SNP National Treasurer from 2004 to 2020; he was defeated in the 2020 SNP internal elections by Douglas Chapman.[7] However, when Chapman later resigned in May 2021, stating ""I had not received the support or financial information required to carry out the fiduciary duties of National Treasurer"", Beattie returned to the position.[8]He was selected unopposed as the SNP's candidate for the 2021 Scottish Parliament election[9] and retained his seat, with an increased majority of 7,906.[10][11]Beattie was formally censured in 2013 by the Standards Commission for Scotland for breaching the Councillors’ code of Conduct for failing to register interest in property whilst a councillor.[12][13]In 2023, he was arrested during the police investigation into the SNP finances.[14] He was later released without charge, but resigned as SNP treasurer the day after.[15]
Personal life[edit]
Beattie is married to former Midlothian Council leader Lisa Beattie.[16] He lives in Dalkeith, Midlothian.[17]

Personal detailsBorn (1959-06-17) 17 June 1959 (age 64)Motherwell, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Socialist Party (1998–present)Other politicalaffiliationsScottish Labour (1970s–1991)Scottish Militant Labour (1991–1998)ResidenceEdinburghColin Fox (born 17 June 1959, in Motherwell) is a national co-spokesperson of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP). He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothians region from 2003 to 2007.
Described in The Herald as ""one of Scotland's most prominent socialists"",[1] he is a founding member of the SSP and Scotland's longest-serving party leader or spokesperson, having been originally elected as the SSP's convener in February 2005. He was a member of the Yes Scotland Advisory Board.

Personal life[edit]
Fox was born in Motherwell. Both of his grandfathers were steelworkers,[2] his mother was a nurse and his father an insurance salesman with the Co-operative Insurance Society. He attended Our Lady's High School[3] before studying Mathematics at Strathclyde University and Accountancy at Bell's College, Hamilton (now part of the University of the West of Scotland).[4] He graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Social Sciences from the Open University in 2013.
Colin currently lives in Edinburgh, with his partner and children.

Political career[edit]
Fox joined Scottish Labour in Motherwell and Wishaw as a teenager and established Labour Party Young Socialists (LPYS) branches throughout Lanarkshire.
He has described Tony Benn as ""one of my heroes"", and says that it was after attending a talk given by Benn at the University of Glasgow, when Benn was running for the Deputy Leadership of the Labour Party, that he was inspired to get involved in politics full-time.[5] As a prominent LPYS activist, he attracted the attention of the Militant tendency, and joined in 1981. He was elected as their Lanarkshire organiser in 1983 and has been heavily involved in socialist politics ever since.
He was active in the 1984–1985 miners's strike in Ayrshire and at the Ravenscraig picket line. The 103-day[6] Caterpillar occupation of 1987–88 saw him involved in the key industrial battle of the time.[7] In 1988, he went to London to work for Militant at its headquarters in Hackney Wick.[8] He held a variety of posts in its industrial department, finance department, and as circulation manager of the Militant newspaper. Here, he was heavily involved in the leadership of the anti-poll tax struggle which brought down Margaret Thatcher.
In 1995, he moved to Edinburgh to take up the role of Scottish Militant Labour's East of Scotland organiser. This was the time when Militant was discarding its entryist tactics and turning towards open mass work. As a member of SML's executive committee, he was heavily involved in the discussions with some smaller groups on the left that led to the formation of the Scottish Socialist Alliance (SSA) in 1995.
The SSA aimed to build a left-wing alternative to New Labour and the SNP. It was built around the slogan ""for an independent socialist Scotland"". Fox was the SSA's East of Scotland organiser, a role he continued to play when the Alliance morphed into the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in 1998.

An MSP in Holyrood[edit]
He led the Scottish Socialist Party in the Lothians into the first Scottish Parliament election in 1999. This was the election where Tommy Sheridan, then an SML councillor,[9] was elected as the SSP MSP for Glasgow region. Over the course of the next four years, Colin helped build the SSP as it trebled in size.
The party in parliament succeeded in passing legislation to abolish poindings and warrant sales in 2002. Using Sheridan's popularity, the SSP made several interventions including supporting the Fire Brigades Union dispute of 2002. But above all, it was the role the party played in the huge movement against the Iraq War that cemented the SSP's place in Scottish politics. Against pundits' predictions,[10] the SSP won six seats at Holyrood in 2003, including Fox in the Lothians region. Winning by just 68 votes out of 300,000,[11] Fox was famously captured on TV hurtling across the floor of Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh when his result was finally declared.[7]Like his SSP colleagues, Fox refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen and was ejected from the swearing-in ceremony for singing Robert Burns' anthem Is There for Honest Poverty (or A Man's a Man for A' That) in protest.[11]He sat on the Scottish Parliament's justice committee for four years and visited many of Scotland's prisons, arguing for reform. He presented a Member's Bill, one of only six to get to the debating floor that session, to abolish National Health Service prescription charges in Scotland. The bill won the backing of the parliament's health committee, but was eventually voted down by Labour, Conservative, and Lib Dem MSPs. The Scottish Government of 2007–11 later picked up the bill and introduced it themselves.

Sheridan's defamation action[edit]
Further information: Sheridan v News Group Newspapers Ltd
Sheridan, the party's then national convenor, chose to sue a tabloid newspaper in November 2004 over stories it published about his private life. Sheridan's decision to sue the News of the World, against the advice of the SSP executive committee, led to it demanding his resignation as convenor. Sheridan lied throughout two high-profile trials and was eventually sentenced to three years in jail, convicted on five counts of perjury.[12]On one occasion, Sheridan asked Fox to lie on his behalf by writing to his solicitor saying minutes of a party meeting where Sheridan admitted going to a swingers' club were false. Fox refused and told Sheridan his strategy was a ""train wreck"".[13][14] Colin Fox later summarised Sheridan's conduct by saying he had ""done more damage to the socialist cause than any good he ever did it"".[15]Fox was subsequently elected SSP national convener in Sheridan's place, defeating Alan McCombes by 252 votes to 154, but the damage done to the party by the Glasgow MSP was substantial.
In response to Tony Blair's plans to bring in variable top-up fees at English universities, Fox commented that previous student politicians, such as Jack Straw and Charles Clarke, ""were only able to be active in student politics because they didn't have £10,000 of debt hanging round their neck and they didn't have to rush off to work in McDonald's"". He added: ""Now they are kicking the ladder away from the people below them.""[4]In June 2005, Fox took part in a peaceful protest, interrupting Question Time in the Scottish Parliament, along with three other SSP MSPs, to highlight their claim that parliament had failed to secure the right to demonstrate outside the Gleneagles Hotel where the G8 were meeting. As a consequence, he was suspended from the Scottish Parliament for the whole of September and the salaries of the party's four MSPs and their staff were stopped—the severest penalty meted out to any peaceful protest in British parliamentary history.[16]
Exit from parliament[edit]
Fox lost his seat in the Scottish Parliament at the 2007 election, but continued to lead the party, campaigning on issues including Scottish independence, fuel poverty, bankers' bonuses, the occupation of Afghanistan,[17]climate change,[18]equal marriage,[19]AIDS,[20] and education cuts.[21] He has contested a number of elections since 2007, standing as his party's top candidate in the 2009 European elections, in the Lothians region for the Scottish Parliament elections in 2007 and 2011, and against Alistair Darling in Edinburgh South West at the 2010 United Kingdom general election.
In 2007, he supported Greenpeace on board their ship Arctic Sunrise in their campaign against the replacement of the UK's nuclear weapons.[22] He had previously visited a nuclear power station on the grounds that ""I am a convinced opponent of nuclear power but an opponent who wants to conduct the debate about new nuclear capacity and our energy needs on the basis of facts. My visit to Torness is at my own request.""[23] In the same year he championed the cause of affordable access to housing with his support of Midlothian Council's investment in providing housing.[24]In 2008, he wrote to the First Minister Alex Salmond seeking an assurance that any future meetings with members of the Northern Ireland Assembly would raise the issue of attitudes towards LGBT rights by its ministers.[25] More recently he has also been involved in opposing community education cuts,[21] and has marched against cuts to public services.[5]In 2012, Fox was invited to join the Yes Scotland Advisory Board as a representative of the SSP when the campaign was launched.

Independence referendum[edit]
As a Yes Scotland Advisory Board member, Colin Fox was in great demand to speak at public meetings on the details of independence all across Scotland. He has shared platforms with Jim Sillars,[26]John McAllion, John Finnie MSP, Jean Urquhart MSP, and Patrick Harvie MSP of the Scottish Greens. He wrote the SSP's pamphlets The Case for an Independent Socialist Scotland and For a Modern Democratic Republic.
Fox addressed independence rallies in Edinburgh in 2012 and 2013,[27] and spoke at the Oxford Union in May 2014 debating the motion: ""This House believes Scotland should be an independent country"".[28] His opponents in the debate included Lord Jim Wallace and the Labour MP for Stirling, Anne McGuire.[29]In June 2014, Fox wrote in the Scotsman: ""No country in the world is more engaged in the democratic debate over self-determination than Scotland today. September’s referendum has energised people to a remarkable extent with debates on the 'democratic deficit' at the heart of Scottish politics now taking place in households, schools, workplaces, village halls and urban community centres from one end of the country to the other.""[30]
After the referendum[edit]
When the make-up of the Smith Commission was announced after the rejection of independence, Colin Fox protested the decision to ""uniquely exclude"" the SSP from proceedings. He wrote to the Smith Commission: ""The argument some use to justify our exclusion on the grounds that we currently have no 'parliamentary representation' fails to appreciate that the referendum was not a parliamentary process but an unprecedented public debate that resulted in an extraordinary level of engagement from all sections of society. To exclude the SSP is to exclude an important constituency of opinion in Scottish society.""[31]In January 2015, Fox travelled to Athens as a guest of Syriza before its victory in the January 2015 Greek legislative election. He met with Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias Turrión, and said the election result was ""something for socialists in Scotland to ponder deeply"".[32]
2022 City of Edinburgh Council election[edit]
Fox stood as a candidate for the Scottish Socialist Party in the Liberton/Gilmerton ward in the 2022 City of Edinburgh Council election.[33]
Other activities[edit]
Fox is the founder and current director of the Edinburgh People's Festival.[34][35]In October 2008, Fox stood for Rector of the University of St Andrews.[36] He came second, losing to Kevin Dunion.[37] He was asked to run for the position by members of St Andrews-based student groups such as Stop The War, due to his previous experience with the pro-peace and social justice movements.[38] After losing the rectorial election in 2008, he maintained his links with the University and visited a student sit-in protest in 2009.[39] He was invited to stand for election as rector again in 2011.

Personal detailsBorn (1977-09-03) 3 September 1977 (age 46)Edinburgh, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourChildren2 daughtersAlma materUniversity of St AndrewsUniversity of StrathclydeDaniel Guy Johnson (born 3 September 1977) is a Scottish Labour politician who has served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Edinburgh Southern constituency since 2016.

Early life[edit]
Johnson was born on 3 September 1977.[1][2] He attended Bonaly Primary School and was privately educated at Stewart's Melville College.[3] He joined the Labour Party at the age of 17.[3] He graduated from the University of St Andrews in philosophy and from the University of Strathclyde in management.[3][4]Johnson's first job after leaving university was working as a constituency caseworker for Edinburgh South's MP Nigel Griffiths.[3] He later went on to work as a management consultant for Accenture.[citation needed] Before he was elected, he became managing director of his father's group of shops: Paper Tiger and Studio One. The group became the first independent retailer in Edinburgh to become an accredited Living Wage employer in 2015.[5]
Political career[edit]
In January 2014, Johnson was selected by party members as a candidate for Edinburgh Southern prior to the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[3] He was elected to the Scottish Parliament in May 2016, gaining the seat from the Scottish National Party.[6] He became shadow education minister for Scottish Labour in May 2016.[7]In December 2017, Johnson was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet as Justice Spokesperson.[8] He resigned on 28 May 2019, the day after it was confirmed Scottish Labour had finished fifth in Scotland in the European Parliament elections and lost both its Scottish MEPs. He criticised the Labour Party's ""direction and leadership"" and noted Labour had finished sixth in Edinburgh. He challenged the party's Brexit policies, stating in his resignation letter he thought Labour should endorse a second referendum and campaign for remaining in the European Union.[9]In September 2020, Daniel Johnson called for Richard Leonard to resign as Scottish Labour leader, saying ""Continuing like this will be disastrous for our party and is why I no longer have confidence in Richard Leonard’s leadership.""[10] After Leonard's resignation, Johnson nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[11] In March 2021, he was put back on to the front bench as the Finance Spokesperson for the Scottish Labour Party. Since 10 April 2023, Johnson has served as Economy, Business and Fair Work spokesperson for the Scottish Labour Party.

Protection of Workers (Retail and Age-Restricted Goods and Services) (Scotland) Bill[edit]
In 2018, Johnson lodged a private member's bill which aimed to protect workers selling age restricted products. The Bill aimed to address increasing violence and abuse that shopworkers face, by introducing a new offence to protect workers and deter potential offenders. As retail workers who enforce a statutory age restriction are upholding the law in the wider public interest, it was argued that this group of workers needed further legal protection to help them carry out their duty.[12]
The Bill proposed a new statutory offence for assaulting, threatening or abusing a retail worker, and proposed a statutory aggravation to that offence where the retail worker is enforcing a statutory age restriction.[13]On the 18 September 2020, the Scottish Government indicated that they would be supporting the progress of the bill throughout parliament, a significant win for Johnson.[14] The Bill was passed in January 2021.[15]
Personal life[edit]
Johnson resides in the constituency with his wife, Jackie, and two daughters.[4]In 2017, Johnson revealed to Scottish Parliament that he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) late in life at the age of 35.[16]

Thompson was an SNP Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 2007 to 2016. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election he became an MSP for the Highlands and Islands region, and then in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election for the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency.

Early life[edit]
Thompson was born in Lossiemouth, Scotland. Prior to entering politics, he had a long career in local government, ending as Director of Protective Services for the Highland Council.[1]
Political career[edit]
In 2007, Thompson was elected from the regional list as MSP for the Highlands and Islands.[2] Thompson received some media attention in the aftermath of the 2007 election because he pointed out to the returning officer that the number of additional members for each party had been wrongly calculated.[3] The initial calculation would have given Labour four additional seats and the SNP none, which would have resulted in Labour gaining a plurality and winning the election. After Thompson challenged this calculation and the figures were correctly calculated, Labour were allocated three seats and the SNP two. This resulted in the SNP gaining a plurality of one seat and enabled them to form the Scottish Government.
In 2011, Thompson was elected for the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency.[4]In February 2014, he was one of seven SNP MSPs that voted against allowing same-sex marriage in Scotland.[5]In July 2020, Thompson quit the SNP to set up the Alliance for Independence, a new pro-Scottish independence party to contest the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, predicting the party could win up to 24 seats, and arguing that voting SNP with both constituency and list votes would ""achieve nothing.""[6] He told The National he believed the new movement could help create a ""supermajority"" in Holyrood at the expense of the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems.[7] In October, the party changed its name to Action for Independence (AFI) in February 2021 after the Alliance for Independence was originally rejected by the Electoral Commission.[8][9][10]On 26 March 2021, Thompson stated that AFI would be standing down all of their candidates in order to support the Alba Party in the 2021 election.[11]

   ​ ​(m. 1987; div. 2012)​Children3, including OliverAlma materUniversity of EdinburghUniversity of StrathclydeWebsitedavidmundell.comDavid Gordon Mundell, WS  (born 27 May 1962) is a Scottish politician and solicitor who served as Secretary of State for Scotland from 2015 to 2019.[1] A member of the Scottish Conservative Party, he has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale since 2005. Mundell was the first openly gay Conservative cabinet minister, formally coming out in 2016.[2][3]From 1999 to 2005, Mundell served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South of Scotland region. He was first elected to the British House of Commons as the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale in 2005 and served as Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland from 2005 to 2010 and Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from 2010 to 2015.[4] He served in the Cabinet as Scotland Secretary from 2015 until 2019; the first Conservative to hold the position since Michael Forsyth in 1997.

Background[edit]
Born in Dumfries, Mundell grew up in Newton Wamphray and Lockerbie.  He attended Lockerbie Academy before reading Law at the University of Edinburgh (MA), also gaining a Diploma in Legal Practice (Dip LP).[5] After further studies, he graduated from Strathclyde Business School as MBA.[citation needed]Having become a Young Conservative aged 14, he switched to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) while at university in 1981.  In 2002, he stated: ""the first Thatcher Government did get a bit bogged down and it wasn't really the radical government that subsequently emerged,... And the fact that you had a completely new opportunity to wipe the slate clean, with no baggage, was a very attractive thing"".[6]He practised as a solicitor before joining BT as Group Legal Advisor for Scotland in 1991. He became BT Scotland's Head of National Affairs, remaining with BT until being elected as an MSP. Mundell served as an SDP Councillor on Annandale and Eskdale District Council from 1984 to 1986, representing Dryfe ward, and then for Mid Annandale ward on Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council until 1987, whilst still a postgraduate student.[7][8]Mundell is a member of the Society of Writers to His Majesty's Signet (WS) and of the Law Society of Scotland.

Parliamentary career[edit]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
Mundell was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and 2003 as a list MSP for the South of Scotland.

House of Commons[edit]
In the 2005 general election, Mundell was elected as MP for the Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale constituency.[9] Following his election to Westminster, Mundell resigned from the Scottish Parliament in June 2005. His seat was taken by Derek Brownlee, who was next on the Conservatives' South of Scotland candidate list.[10] As the sole Conservative Scottish parliamentary representative, David Cameron (as Leader of HM Opposition) appointed him Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland in December 2005.
Mundell was among the 18 MPs (either Scottish or representing Scottish constituencies) who supported the Commons Motion stating football ""should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage"", thereby endorsing the idea of Team GB entering a British football team in the London 2012 Olympics. Football's governing bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland oppose a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments.[11]Mundell represented the Scottish Conservative Party at the three Scottish Leaders' Debates broadcast on ITV1, Sky News and BBC1 during the 2010 general election campaign.
Mundell retained his seat at the 2019 general election with a reduced majority.[12][13]On 6 June, Mundell voted no confidence in Prime Minister Johnson.

Government minister[edit]
Before the 2010 general election, Mundell served as the Conservative Shadow Scottish Secretary. Following that election, the Conservative Party formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. He held the non-cabinet role of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, since the office of Secretary of State for Scotland was given to Liberal Democrat MP Danny Alexander (then Michael Moore and Alistair Carmichael), in view of the Liberal Democrats' greater representation of Scottish seats. On 9 June 2010, Mundell was appointed a Privy Counsellor.[14][15]Mundell was returned to Parliament at the 2015 general election with a much reduced majority of 798 votes (1.5%), although the Conservative Party's share of the vote increased by 1.8%.[16] He succeeded Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael as Secretary of State for Scotland. In the referendum on EU membership of June 2016, Mundell supported Britain remaining within the EU.[17] Following it, he became a part-time member of the cabinet committee working on strategies for Brexit.[18] He was the only Conservative MP to represent a Scottish constituency in the 56th parliament (2015–2017), but was joined by a further twelve in the 2017 snap general election. Following the election of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Mundell was sacked from his role and went to the backbenches for the first time since he was elected as an MP.[citation needed]
Constituency issues[edit]
In 2015, Mundell opened a food bank in the Dumfries and Galloway constituency, which adjoins his own and was at the time represented by the Scottish National Party's Richard Arkless. After the opening, Mundell was escorted from an angry anti-austerity demonstration by police.[19] Mundell, who had previously denied that welfare reform changes were behind the increased demand for food banks, was accused of hypocrisy by opponents who said the opening was ""nothing to celebrate"".  Mundell said he was willing to work with all local organisations who wanted to eradicate poverty.[2]
Trade envoy[edit]
On 23 August 2021, Boris Johnson appointed Mundell as the UK's trade envoy to New Zealand.[20] On 6 July 2022, he resigned from his position as Trade Envoy following the Chris Pincher scandal, amid the July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis.[21]
Personal life[edit]
On 13 January 2016, Mundell publicly came out as gay on his personal website; he is believed to be the first openly gay Conservative cabinet minister.[2][3]His nickname is 'Fluffy'.[22]Previously married to Lynda Jane Carmichael from 1987, the couple divorced in 2012. He has three children, one of whom, Oliver Mundell, is the Conservative MSP for Dumfriesshire, having won his seat in the Scottish Parliament in May 2016.[23]

Personal detailsBornDavid Martin Scott Steel (1938-03-31) 31 March 1938 (age 85)Kirkcaldy, ScotlandPolitical partyIndependent (since 2020)Other politicalaffiliationsLiberal Democrats (1988–2020)Liberal (until 1988)SpouseJudith MacGregor ​(m. 1962)​Children3ParentDavid SteelAlma materUniversity of EdinburghSignatureDavid Martin Scott Steel, Baron Steel of Aikwood, KT, KBE, PC (born 31 March 1938) is a retired Scottish politician.[1] Elected as Member of Parliament for Roxburgh, Selkirk, and Peebles, followed by Tweeddale, Ettrick, and Lauderdale, he served as the final leader of the Liberal Party, from 1976 to 1988. His tenure spanned the duration of the alliance with the Social Democratic Party, which began in 1981 and concluded with the formation of the Liberal Democrats in 1988.[1]Steel served as a Member of the UK Parliament for 32 years, from 1965 to 1997, and as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2003, during which time he was the parliament's Presiding Officer. He was a member of the House of Lords as a life peer from 1997 to 2020. Steel resigned from the House of Lords after the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse accused him of an ""abdication of responsibility"" over his failure to investigate allegations of child sex abuse against the former Liberal MP Cyril Smith.[2]
Early life and education[edit]
Steel was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, the son of a Church of Scotland minister also called David Steel, who would later serve as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He was brought up in Scotland and Kenya, and educated at Dumbarton Academy; James Gillespie's Boys' School, Edinburgh; the Prince of Wales School, Nairobi; and George Watson's College, Edinburgh,[3] followed by the University of Edinburgh, where he first took an active part in Liberal politics, and was elected Senior President of the Students' Representative Council,[4] and graduated in Law. Steel was president of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement campaign from 1966 to 1970.[5][6]
Political career[edit]

Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately from the article and its talk page, especially if potentially libelous.Find sources: ""David Steel"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR  (January 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)After university, Steel worked for the Scottish Liberal Party, and then the BBC, before being elected to the House of Commons as the MP for Roxburgh, Selkirk, and Peebles at the 1965 by-election, just before his 27th birthday, becoming the ""Baby of the House"". He represented this seat until 1983, when he was elected in Tweeddale, Ettrick, and Lauderdale, a new constituency covering much of the same territory. From 1966 to 1970, Steel was president of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement campaign.[7][8]As an MP, he was responsible for introducing, as a Private member's bill, the Abortion Act 1967, and has argued for greater liberalisation of this legislation in recent years (see Abortion in the United Kingdom).[9] He also became the Liberal Party's spokesman on employment, and, in 1970, its Chief Whip.

Leader of Liberal Party[edit]
In 1976, following the downfall of Jeremy Thorpe, and a short period in which Jo Grimond acted as caretaker leader, he won the Liberal leadership by a wide margin over John Pardoe. At only 38 years old, he was one of the youngest party leaders in British history. In March 1977, he led the Liberals into the ""Lib–Lab pact"". The Liberals agreed to support the Labour government, whose narrow majority since the general election in October 1974 had been gradually eroded and left them as a minority government, in power, in return for a degree of prior consultation on policy. This pact lasted until August 1978.[10]Steel was criticised, both then and since, for not driving a harder bargain. However, Steel's defenders contend that the continuing scandal surrounding Thorpe left the party in a very weak state to face an early general election, and Steel was wise to buy himself some time from Prime Minister James Callaghan. At the same time, the growing unpopularity of the Labour government impaired the Liberals' performance, and Steel's first election as leader, the 1979 general election, saw a net two-seat loss for the Liberals.

SDP–Liberal Alliance[edit]
In 1981, a group of Labour moderates left their party to form the Social Democratic Party. They were joined by the former Labour deputy leader, Chancellor and Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, who had previously had discussions with Steel about joining the Liberals. Under Jenkins' leadership, the SDP joined the Liberals in the SDP–Liberal Alliance. In its early days, the Alliance showed so much promise that for a time, it looked like the Liberals would be part of a government for the first time since 1945. Opinion polls were showing Alliance support as high as 50% by late 1981. Steel was so confident that he felt able to tell delegates at the Liberal Assembly that year: ""Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!""[11] In the wake of the 1981 Croydon North West by-election, where Liberal candidate Bill Pitt came from third position to easily gain the Alliance's first by-election victory, Steel's reaction to the result was to state that his belief ""that we are now unstoppable.""[12]Steel had genuine hopes at that stage that the Alliance would win the next general election and form a coalition government. However, the beginning of the Falklands War the following spring radically shifted the attitude of the electorate, and the Conservatives regained the lead in polls from the Alliance by a wide margin.[13] The Alliance secured more than 25% of the vote at the 1983 general election, almost as many votes as Labour. However, its support was spread out across the country, and was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into seats under the first past the post system. This left the Alliance with only 23 seats — 17 for the Liberals, and six for the SDP. Steel's dreams of a big political breakthrough were left unfulfilled.[14]Shortly afterwards, the former Labour Foreign Secretary David Owen replaced Jenkins as leader of the SDP, and the troubled leadership of the ""Two Davids"" was inaugurated. It was never an easy relationship—Steel's political sympathies were well to the left of Owen's. Owen had a marked antipathy towards the Liberals, though he respected Steel's prior loyalty to his own party contrasting it with Jenkins' lack of interest in preserving the SDP's independence. The relationship was also mercilessly satirised by Spitting Image which portrayed Steel as a squeaky voiced midget, literally in the pocket of Owen. Steel has often stated that he feels this portrayal seriously damaged his image.[15] This portrayal of Steel as weaker than Owen was also present in other satires, such as Private Eye's Battle for Britain strip. The relationship finally fell apart during the 1987 general election when the two contradicted each other, both on defence policy and on which party they would do a deal with in the event of a hung parliament.

Two parties merge[edit]
Steel addressing the Liberal Party assembly in Harrogate on merger in 1987Steel was convinced the answer to these difficulties was a single party with a single leader, and was the chief proponent of the 1988 merger between the Liberals and the SDP. He emerged victorious in persuading both parties to accept merger in the teeth of opposition from Owen and radical Liberals such as Michael Meadowcroft, but badly mishandled the issuing of a joint policy document. Steel had often been criticised for a lack of interest in policy, and it appeared he had agreed to the document – drawn up by politically naive SDP advisers – without reading it. His colleagues rejected it immediately and demanded a redraft, fatally wounding his authority.
Steel was briefly joint interim leader of the Social and Liberal Democrats (as the new party was at first called) in the run-up to elections in which he did not stand, before becoming the party's foreign affairs spokesman. In 1989, he accepted an invitation from Italian Liberals to stand for the European Parliament in the 1989 election as a Pan-European gesture. Although not elected, he polled very well.
He became President of the Liberal International in 1994, holding the office until 1996.[16]
Life peerage and Scottish Parliament[edit]
Steel retired from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election and was made a life peer as Baron Steel of Aikwood, of Ettrick Forest in the Scottish Borders, on 6 June 1997.[17] He campaigned for Scottish devolution, and in 1999 was elected to the Scottish Parliament as a Liberal Democrat MSP for Lothians. He became the first Presiding Officer (speaker) of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999.[18]In this role, he used the style ""Sir David Steel"", despite his peerage. He suspended his Liberal Democrat membership for the duration of his tenure as Presiding Officer, believing that the post, like the Speaker of the UK House of Commons, should be strictly nonpartisan. All subsequent Presiding Officers have followed this practice.
He stepped down as an MSP when the parliament was dissolved for the 2003 election, but remained as Presiding Officer until he had supervised the election of his successor George Reid on 7 May of that year. He was appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in both 2003 and 2004.[citation needed]
Cyril Smith child sex abuse scandal[edit]
On 14 March 2019, Steel was suspended by the Liberal Democrats after an admission that discussions he had conducted in 1979 with the then Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, at a time when Steel was leader of the Liberal Party, had led him to conclude that Smith had been a sexual abuser of children in the 1960s and that Steel nonetheless failed to instigate any assessment by the party of whether Smith was an on-going risk to children. Richard Scorer, representing victims at the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, called for him to be stripped of his peerage.[19] On 14 May 2019, the Liberal Democrats ruled that there were ""no grounds for action"" against Steel and reinstated him to party membership.[20]On 25 February 2020, Steel announced his resignation from the Liberal Democrats and subsequently his position as a member of the House of Lords, after admitting that during his leadership of the Liberal Party he ""assumed"" that Smith had been a child abuser, and failed to investigate claims made by Private Eye against Smith, dating from before Smith was a party member.[21] This came about after the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse accused Steel of an ""abdication of responsibility"" over allegations against Smith. He retired officially from the House of Lords on 27 March 2020.[22]

Personal life and family[edit]
Steel married fellow law graduate Judith Mary MacGregor in October 1962. They resided at Aikwood Tower in the Borders of Scotland for twenty years, but now live in Selkirk. They have two sons and a daughter, and nine grandchildren.[4] In 1995, his elder son Graeme was convicted for growing cannabis at his house, and sent to prison for nine months.[29] One of his granddaughters, Hannah, was elected to Scottish Borders Council (representing the Galashiels and District ward) in the 2022 Scottish local elections.[30]His recreations are angling and classic car rallying: he won the bronze medallion in 1998 for London to Cape Town. He is a member of the National Liberal and Royal Over-Seas League clubs.[1]

Personal detailsBornDennis Andrew Canavan (1942-08-08) 8 August 1942 (age 81)Cowdenbeath, ScotlandPolitical partyIndependent (1999–present)Other politicalaffiliationsLabour (1974–1999)Alma materUniversity of EdinburghDennis Andrew Canavan  (born 8 August 1942) is a Scottish politician. He was the Member of Parliament for Falkirk West from 1974 to 2000 (known as West Stirlingshire from 1974 to 1983), first as a member of the Labour Party, and then as an Independent.  He then served as an Independent Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Falkirk West from 1999 to 2007.
In 2014, he was the chair of the Advisory Board of Yes Scotland, the campaign for independence in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.

Early life[edit]
Born in Cowdenbeath, Canavan was educated at St. Bride's and St. Columba's Schools, Cowdenbeath, St Andrew's College, Drygrange,[1] and at the University of Edinburgh. He worked as a schoolteacher from 1968 until 1974 and was Assistant Head of Holy Rood High School Edinburgh at the time of his first election to Parliament. Canavan was also head of the maths department at St Modans High in Stirling.

Career[edit]
British Parliament[edit]
He was leader of the Labour Party Group on Stirling District Council in 1974 and, in October of that year, was elected as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for West Stirlingshire. Following boundary changes, he was MP for Falkirk West from 1983 to 2000. He was Chair of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Group from 1980 to 1981. In 1975, he tried introducing a bill to abolish corporal punishment in schools and his efforts formed part of the case presented to the European Commission of Human Rights which led eventually to abolition. He voted against the Blair Government's proposals to cut benefits for children of lone parents, abolish student grants and introduce tuition fees.
A keen sports enthusiast, he was founder and Convener of the Scottish Sports Group at Westminster and the Cross-Party Sports Group in the Scottish Parliament. He has completed a marathon in less than three hours and the Ben Nevis Race in just over two hours. He won a gold medal, playing for Scotland in the British Universities Football Championships in 1967. In his book The Final Whistle?, Harry Reid claims that Canavan took part in the 1977 Wembley pitch invasion after Scotland beat England and ripped up a patch of the turf.[2]He takes an active interest in international affairs and served as a member of the House of Commons select committees on Foreign Affairs and International Development. He is still a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Amnesty International and is interested in conflict resolution.
He chaired the Northern Ireland Committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party from 1989 to 1997, and led several parliamentary delegations to Ireland during The Troubles. He served on the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body from 1992 to 2000. As a member of the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament, he was author of a report on the potential for co-operation between Scotland and Ireland. He has frequently spoken out against sectarianism and racism.

Scottish Parliament[edit]
Throughout his political life, Canavan played a leading part in the campaign for a Scottish Parliament. When Labour was in opposition, he led a nationwide consultation about devolution, on behalf of the Scottish Group of Labour MPs, leading to the publication of a bill to establish a Scottish Parliament with revenue-raising powers. However, in 1999, when the first elections to the Scottish Parliament were held, the New Labour leadership rejected him as an official Labour candidate, despite the fact that he had the support of 97% of local party members. He therefore stood as an Independent, and was consequently expelled from the party.[3] Although there were rumours he would join the Scottish National Party, he did not join another party. He won with almost 55 percent of the vote, the highest majority of any MSP in the 1999 election. He resigned his Westminster seat in 2000 to concentrate on representing his constituents in the Scottish Parliament. Canavan retained his Holyrood seat in 2003 with 55.7 percent of the vote, again with the biggest majority in Scotland.
In the Scottish Parliament, he was a member of the European and External Relations Committee and Convener of the All-Party Sports Group from 1999.[4][5]
In 2003 he criticised the Scottish football authorities when Falkirk Football Club was refused promotion to the Scottish Premier League, despite having won the First Division Championship. He supported Falkirk's efforts to build a new stadium for community use and he still regularly attends the club's matches. He is also Honorary President of Milton Amateurs Football Club.
Canavan enjoys hill-walking and, in the Scottish Parliament, he championed the people's right of access to the countryside, successfully introducing amendments to the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to extend the right of access to country estates, including land belonging to the Queen. He is now President of Ramblers Scotland.
He is a strong supporter of the idea of a national holiday to celebrate St Andrew's Day, and his bill to achieve this was eventually passed as the St. Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007.

Retirement[edit]
When he announced his retirement before the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections,[6] he was the longest serving parliamentarian in the Scottish Parliament, having completed a combined 33 years at Westminster and Holyrood. After this announcement he received an ovation in the Chamber of the Scottish Parliament from other MSPs and was praised by the First Minister Jack McConnell as ""an outstanding parliamentarian over a long, long period of time"".[7]In April 2010, Canavan declared his support for John McNally, the Scottish National Party candidate for Falkirk in the 2010 general election. Falkirk is the successor to Canavan's former Westminster constituency.[8]He has honorary doctorates from the Universities of Stirling and Strathclyde.
In recognition of his public service, Falkirk Council launched the Dennis Canavan Scholarship to encourage young people to go on to further or higher education and to use their talents to help others.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Canavan's marriage to Elnor Canavan ended in divorce. They had four children, all of whom predeceased him; he also has a son with his partner.[10][11]

A member of the Scottish Conservative Party, he was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South of Scotland region from 2005 to 2011.

Background[edit]
Brownlee grew up in Selkirk, Scottish Borders and went to Selkirk High School. He graduated in Scots Law LLB (Hons) from the University of Aberdeen in 1996, and then trained as a chartered accountant. He worked as a chartered accountant at Ernst & Young from 1996 to 2002, the Institute of Directors from 2002 to 2004 and Deloitte from 2004 to 2005.

Political career[edit]
In the 2003 Scottish Parliament election Brownlee stood as the Conservative candidate in Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale constituency, finishing fourth but within 1,500 votes of winning the seat.
He became an MSP on 17 April 2005, following David Mundell resigning his regional seat at Holyrood following his election as MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale constituency in the 2005 General Election.[1][2] Brownlee was next on the Conservative's list for the South of Scotland region.[2] Brownlee was appointed the Conservative's finance spokesman in Holyrood in July 2005, replacing Annabel Goldie who became the party's leader in Scotland.
Brownlee stood at the 2007 Holyrood elections, contesting the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale constituency, coming third – pushing the Labour candidate into fourth place. He was again elected as an additional member for the South of Scotland region. After the 2007 election, Brownlee was a member of the Scottish Parliament's Finance Committee and a substitute member of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit.[3]In 2010 Brownlee was selected by the East Lothian Conservative Party as their candidate for the East Lothian at the 2011 Holyrood election.[4] Brownlee was placed at the top of the Conservatives' South Scotland list after a ballot of party members. At the 2011 election, the Conservatives took three constituency seats in the region but no regional seats and Brownlee failed to be re-elected.

Notes[edit]

^ Normally, regional MSPs do not have individual predecessors and successors. However, Mundell retired his seat during a sitting parliament so was succeeded by Brownlee.

Personal detailsBornDerek John Mackay1977Paisley, ScotlandPolitical partyIndependent (from 2020)SNP (until 2020)[1]Children2ResidenceBishopton, Renfrewshire
Derek Mackay (born 1977)[2] is a former Scottish politician who served as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work from 2016 to 2020. A former member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Renfrewshire North and West from 2011 to 2021. Mackay served as a government minister from 2011 to 2020 under the administrations of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. 
Raised in Renfrewshire, he was elected to Renfrewshire Council in 1999 and was Leader of the Council from 2007 to 2011. Elected to the Scottish Parliament at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, he served as Minister for Transport and Islands from 2011 to 2014 and Minister for Local Government and Planning from 2014 to 2016, as well as Chairman and Business Convener of the Scottish National Party from 2011 to 2018.
Mackay became Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution in 2016, succeeding Deputy First Minister John Swinney. In 2018, during a Cabinet reshuffle, Mackay's post was enlarged, absorbing the responsibilities of the previous role of Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work to become Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work. In February 2020, he resigned as Finance Secretary after the Scottish Sun reported he had messaged a 16-year-old boy on social media, describing the boy as ""cute"" and offering to meet with him. He was also suspended from the SNP and sat as an independent MSP for the remainder of the 2016 parliamentary term, which ended on 25 March 2021.

Early life[edit]
Mackay was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, as the eldest of three children. His father was a violent alcoholic.[3] In Mackay's early teens, he fled from his father with his mother and younger brother, becoming briefly homeless.[4][5] He was educated at Kirklandneuk Primary School and Renfrew High School.[6] MacKay became the first in his family to attend university, studying social work at the University of Glasgow, however, he later dropped out to pursue a career in politics.[4][7]He joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) at 16 and was involved in both the youth, where he served as National Convener from 1998–2002, and student movements.[6]
Political career[edit]
Mackay was first elected as a councillor in 1999, representing the Blythswood Ward on Renfrewshire Council. He was re-elected in 2003 and 2007 (for the new multi-member ward of Renfrew North in the latter) and became leader of Renfrewshire Council in May 2007, taking the SNP from opposition to lead the administration for the first time.[8]He became a national figure in local government, leading the SNP group in the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) from 2009 to 2011.[8] He coordinated the SNP campaign in the 2012 Scottish local government elections and the 2017 general election.[9]At the 2011 election, Mackay was adopted for the new constituency of Renfrewshire North and West while also being placed third on the SNP regional list for West Scotland region. Upon his election as the constituency MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, he was placed on the Finance Committee and also appointed as the SNP's Business Convener and Parliamentary Liaison Officer to the Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy Bruce Crawford MSP.[citation needed]Following a mini-reshuffle Mackay replaced Aileen Campbell as Minister for Local Government and Planning on 7 December 2011. When Nicola Sturgeon became First Minister of Scotland he was appointed as Minister for Transport and Islands.[10]Following the Scottish Parliament election in 2016, Mackay was promoted to the Scottish Cabinet to serve as Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution.[8] After a reshuffle in June 2018, Economy and Fair Work was added to his portfolio.[8]In June 2011, Mackay was appointed as the SNP's Business Convener (party chair), succeeding Bruce Crawford. The Business Convener is responsible for chairing the SNP's Party Conference and the National Executive Committee; overseeing the party's management, administration and operations, as well as the coordination of election campaigns; working with the Chief Executive of Headquarters in setting priorities. Mackay stepped down from the role in October 2018.[citation needed]
Resignation[edit]
On 5 February 2020, the Scottish Sun alerted the office of Nicola Sturgeon about a story they were planning to run revealing Mackay had sent a 16-year-old boy messages via Facebook and Instagram in which he described the boy as ""cute"" and offered to meet up with the boy in person.[11][12][13][14] The paper told the BBC they had been approached by the boy's mother who had become aware of the messages in the week prior.[12]The Scottish Government was accused of trying to stop publication of the Scottish Sun article, questioning the ""justification"" of intruding into Mackay's private life and claiming the Scottish Sun had a “moral obligation"" to share the material in order for them ""to offer any form of substantive response or view"". The paper defended its position, stating that Alan Muir, its Scottish editor, had read out the ""most significant and damaging messages"" to Sturgeon’s office in two 15-minute phone conversations.[11]On 6 February, Mackay resigned hours before the Scottish budget was due to be announced. Sturgeon announced he had been suspended from the SNP and she had accepted his resignation, recognising his ""significant contribution to government"" but admitting his behaviour ""failed to meet the standards required"". Scottish Conservative acting leader Jackson Carlaw suggested the messages could ""constitute the grooming of a young individual"" and called for Mackay to resign from the Scottish Parliament.[13]On 8 February, Police Scotland said that it had spoken to the schoolboy and that while it had not ""received any complaint of criminality"", it was ""assessing available information"".[15] It subsequently announced that it had reviewed the case and that Mackay would not face any charges, as no laws had been broken, with 16 being the age of consent in Scotland.[16]Mackay sat as an Independent for the rest of 2016–2021 parliament term and stood down as an MSP when it ended on 5 May 2021.[17]
Personal life[edit]
Mackay came out as gay in 2013 and separated from his wife.[18] They have two sons together.[19]Mackay lives in Bishopton, Renfrewshire, near Glasgow, with his partner. He is involved with the Paisley Fairtrade Partnership, and is a member of CND and Amnesty International.[20] He was the Honorary Vice President of the Battalion for Paisley and District Boys' Brigade,[21] until being sacked from the position following his resignation scandal.[22]In February 2020, it was reported by a former senior SNP staff member that Nicola Sturgeon had banned Mackay from drinking at SNP conferences, because of reports around his behaviour. Mackay joked to attendees at the 2017 party conference that they would not see him later as, ""Nicola won't let me"".[23][11]

bodyDorothy-Grace ElderMember of the Scottish Parliamentfor Glasgow(1 of 7 Regional MSPs)In office6 May 1999 – 31 March 2003
Personal detailsBorn1942Dundee, ScotlandPolitical partyIndependent (2002–2003)Scottish National Party (until 2002)Dorothy-Grace Elder is a Scottish journalist and former Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region 1999–2003. She sat as an Independent MSP 2002–2003, having first sat as a Scottish National Party member from 1999 until she left the party in 2002. Among achievements for campaigning, she was awarded the 1996 Britain's Reporter of the Year for investigative journalism at the British Press Awards. In 2019, she was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Scottish Press Awards.

Journalism[edit]
Elder was the first woman to run an investigative team, ""The Insiders"", on the Glasgow Herald, where she worked on reporters, news features and leaders. She was later recruited by TV, beginning with BBC Scotland's news programme Reporting Scotland. She wrote, filmed and produced numerous documentaries on social injustices for STV and the network. Other programmes for Scottish Television include Paramedics.[1] and the first Scottish documentary on AIDS in 1988. For BBC Scotland and BBC Two, she filmed ""I Preferred Madness""- the life story of Scots television pioneer John Logie Baird – filming between the UK, Canada and New York.
She worked as features editor and columnist on Scotland's first cooperatively run newspaper, the ill-fated Scottish Daily News.[2]Elder has written columns and investigations for papers, including The Herald, Sunday Mail, Scotland on Sunday ""Rattling the Cages"" the Scottish Daily Express ""Off the Leash"", The Daily Express (UK) ""Dear Dorothy"".
She campaigned against conditions in Russian prisons for the destitute, including street children.
In 2007, she was appointed to an honorary professorship from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen.[3] She lectures in investigative journalism to honours year students of the university.

Political career[edit]
In June 1998, she was announced as an SNP candidate for the newly formed Scottish Parliament in the elections that would take place the following year.[4]In the 1999 election she stood in the Glasgow Baillieston constituency and gained a 17% swing to the SNP in a former Labour heartland. Although she did not win the seat outright,[5] she was elected on the list to Parliament as a Scottish National Party (SNP) representative for Glasgow region.  She was a member of the Health and Community Care Committee and a member of the Public Petitions Committee.[6] A left-winger, she supported Alex Neil in the SNP leadership election of 2000.
As an MSP, Elder continued campaigning.  She researched pollution and ill health in the East End of Glasgow, becoming the first MSP to take a pollution case to Brussels against dumping in the East End and an incinerator for dead cattle being allowed near housing and a hospital.  She won the case in Europe.  While in the Scottish Parliament, Elder launched a cross party group to look at shortage of help for chronic pain patients. In February 2002, she led a member's debate on the issue. Scotland had no residential service for severe chronic pain cases, with some sent hundreds of miles to Bath. Elder fought for 12 years for a residential service in Scotland, which was achieved in 2015. She continues to be strongly involved with the cross-party group, long after her term as MSP finished.[7]She became dissatisfied with the way in which the SNP was being run and in May 2002 she resigned from the SNP. From that point, she sat in the Parliament as an independent MSP.[8] She did not stand for re-election at the 2003 election, returning to journalism instead.[9]She is also a former Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association candidate for the post of rector of the University of Glasgow, losing to the actor Richard Wilson in 1996.[10] She was known for her campaigning abilities.
Reflecting on her political career in 2021, Elder wrote that despite sharing an office for three years with future First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Sturgeon had refused to speak to her. She also claimed that: ""I was reported to the chief whip after a woman MSP and one of Nicola [Sturgeon]’s chums discovered I had privately asked a women’s group for advice on male bullying in politics... I was set to be disciplined. It made me sick and I walked out.""[11] The SNP responded: ""Ms Elder has not been a member for almost two decades.""[12]

Personal detailsBorn (1971-08-31) 31 August 1971 (age 52)Aberdeen, Scotland, United KingdomPolitical partyScottish ConservativesDouglas Aaron Lumsden[1] (born 31 August 1971) is a Scottish Conservative Party politician.[2] He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the North East Scotland region since the election in May 2021.[3] He was previously the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council.[3]
Early life and education[edit]
Douglas was born in Aberdeen in 1971 to parents Douglas and June Lumsden. The younger Douglas was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Robert Gordon University, where he studied Electronic and Electrical Engineering.

Career[edit]
Lumsden worked in the IT industry from 1993 to 2017. It was in 2017 that he was first elected to Aberdeen City Council, as one of three councillors representing the Airyhall/Broomhill/Garthdee ward.[4][5] He was co-leader of the council from 2017 until 2021. Lumsden contested the Aberdeen South seat at the 2019 United Kingdom general election and came second.[4]In December 2020, Lumsden planned to ask the UK government to fund Aberdeen Council directly, bypassing the Scottish government. He was criticised by the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats for disrespecting Scottish devolution;[6] however, the Liberal Democrats also criticised the Scottish government for giving Aberdeen ""a horrible and unfair deal on funding"". Lumsden claimed that his concern was that ""lobbying the Scottish Government and COSLA (Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) for a fairer funding settlement"" has not been taken seriously.[7]At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Lumsden was selected as a list MSP to represent North East Scotland.[2]On 12 January 2022, Lumsden called for Boris Johnson to resign as party leader and Prime Minister over the Westminster lockdown parties controversy, along with a majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs.[8]Lumsden remained a councillor and continued to draw both salaries after his election to Holyrood in order to avoid the expense of a by-election.[9] He did not stand at the 2022 Aberdeen City Council election.[10]

Personal detailsBornDouglas Gordon Ross (1983-01-27) 27 January 1983 (age 40)Aberdeen, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesOther politicalaffiliationsScottish Liberal Democrats (formerly)SpouseKrystle Ross ​(m. 2015)​Children2Alma materScottish Agricultural CollegeDouglas Gordon Ross (born 27 January 1983) is a British politician who has served as Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party since 2020 and Leader of the Opposition in Scotland since 2021. He has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Moray since 2017. In addition to his seat in Westminster, he serves as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Highlands and Islands, having been elected as a regional list MSP in 2021. He was previously MSP for the region from 2016 to 2017.
Born in Aberdeen, Ross was educated at Forres Academy. After graduating from the Scottish Agricultural College, he worked on a dairy farm. A member of the Scottish Liberal Democrats in his youth, he switched to the Scottish Conservatives and began his political career as a Scottish Parliament researcher and then a councillor in Moray. He stood unsuccessfully for the Moray UK Parliament constituency in the 2010 and 2015 general elections and for the Scottish Parliament constituency in 2011 and 2016. In the latter election, he was elected as a regional list MSP as one of the additional members for the Highlands and Islands.
Ross was elected to the House of Commons at the 2017 general election, defeating SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson, and was re-elected in 2019 with a reduced majority. He served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland under Prime Minister Boris Johnson for six months. He resigned in May 2020, in protest at Dominic Cummings continuing to serve as Johnson's adviser after breaking lockdown rules during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Following the resignation of Jackson Carlaw in July 2020, Ross announced his candidature in the August 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election. Five days later, he was elected leader unopposed. He ran on a joint ticket with former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson. Since he served in the House of Commons and was not an MSP, Davidson led the party in the Scottish Parliament until the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.
Ross has announced that he will not seek re-election as an MP at the next general election.[1]
Early life and career[edit]
Douglas Gordon Ross was born in Aberdeen on 27 January 1983 to Sandy and Lesley Ross.[2][3] In childhood he first attended Alves Primary School and the state secondary Forres Academy before going on to study agriculture at the Scottish Agricultural College.[4][3][5] After graduating, he worked on a dairy farm near Forres, Moray, where his father had been working as a cattleman.[6] He was a member of the Scottish Liberal Democrats in his youth but later became a Conservative voter.[3]
Early political career[edit]
Ross began his political career when he took up a post as a parliamentary researcher at the Scottish Parliament.[3] He was first elected to The Moray Council in 2007, representing the Fochabers-Lhanbryde ward, and became part of the Independent/Conservative administration. He resigned from the council administration in December 2009 but continued as a councillor.[7] In 2012, he was re-elected to The Moray Council and again became part of the ruling administration group but was ""ousted"" from this in 2014, following a debate about school closures.[8]Ross stood as the Conservative candidate for Moray at the 2010 and 2015 general elections, coming second to Angus Robertson but increased his share of the vote by 5.0% in 2015. He also stood as the Conservative candidate for the Moray Scottish Parliament constituency at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election but finished second to Richard Lochhead. At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Ross increased his vote by 18.0% but again finished behind Lochhead. However, he was elected to the Scottish Parliament after being placed first on the Highlands and Islands regional list.[9] He supported the UK remaining within the European Union in the 2016 membership referendum.[10]Ross stood again for the seat of Moray at the 2017 general election, challenging SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson. He was successful in overturning Robertson's 9,065 majority with 22,637 votes, 47.6% of the votes cast, gaining a 16.5% swing to the Conservatives.[11] Having gained a seat at Westminster, Ross resigned from his seat in the Scottish Parliament.[3]In 2017, Ross said during an interview that if he was Prime Minister for a day ""without any repercussions"", he would ""like to see tougher enforcement against Gypsy Travellers"". His remark was criticised, including by Naomi McAuliffe of Amnesty International.[12][13] Ross apologised for his use of language.[14] The Scottish Football Association launched a disciplinary investigation into his remarks, which did not lead to any formal disciplinary action, but warned him to pay attention to his use of language.[15][16]SNP and Labour spokespeople criticised Ross for missing a debate on Universal Credit in October 2017, due to his commitments as a football referee.[17] Shortly afterwards, Ross decided he would no longer accept referee appointments while the UK Parliament is sitting.[18]Despite backing remaining in the EU prior to the referendum, Ross stated Parliament should complete Brexit to ""deliver the will of the British people"". He voted against Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement at the first round of voting and was absent for the second following his wife going into labour. He supported Mark Harper then subsequently Boris Johnson in the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election.[3]Ross was re-elected at the 2019 general election with a reduced majority.[19] He was then appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, replacing Colin Clark who had lost his seat in the election.[20] He resigned from this role on 26 May 2020, in protest against Dominic Cummings continuing to serve as Chief Adviser to the Prime Minister after having travelled over 260 miles (420 kilometres) from London to Durham during the COVID-19 lockdown period.[21][22]
Leadership of the Scottish Conservatives[edit]
Ross announced his candidature in the August 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election following Jackson Carlaw's resignation on 30 July 2020. On 5 August, he won the contest unopposed and became leader.[23] On 11 August, he conducted a reshuffle where he made Ruth Davidson the Leader of the Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament, dismissed Annie Wells and Liam Kerr from their deputy leadership positions and did not give Carlaw a position.[24] As a result of the Alex Salmond parliamentary inquiry in early 2021, Ross called on opposition parties to pass a motion of no confidence against the Scottish Government.[25][26]Upon becoming leader, Ross announced plans to run for a seat in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and succeed Davidson as his party's leader in Holyrood.[24] He was subsequently elected on the Highlands and Islands regional list. The Scottish Conservatives won 31 seats in total, matching their 2016 result and recording the party's highest ever vote share. Following his re-election to the Scottish Parliament, Ross announced his intention to remain MP for Moray while serving as an MSP. The Scottish Parliament website confirms that Ross will donate his MSP salary to charities.[27][28] Other parties have called on him to resign from his MP role.[29]In November 2021, Ross referred himself to the parliamentary watchdog after it was revealed he failed to record his salary and earnings as a linesman in his registers of interest at the UK Parliament, all of which amounted to £28,000 not being recorded.[30][31][32] He subsequently apologised for his actions and said it was an error on his part however there were also calls for his resignation because of the affair.[32][33][34]In January 2022, after Ross called for the resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson amid the Downing Street party scandal, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Leader of the House of Commons, commented: ""I don't think Douglas Ross is a big figure. I think Alister Jack is a really serious and senior figure.""[35] It was then reported that Ross had sent in a letter of no-confidence in Boris Johnson to the 1922 Committee.[36] Less than two months later, in response to the invasion of Ukraine, Ross announced that he had withdrawn his letter, saying “the middle of an international crisis is not the time to be discussing resignations”.[37] Despite this, he was one of four of the six Scottish Conservative MPs who voted against Johnson in the June confidence vote, though stressed he had not resubmitted his letter.[38]After poor results in the 2022 Scottish local elections, Ross said he intended to remain as leader.[39] Under him, on 12 October 2023, fellow MP Lisa Cameron defected to the Conservatives, becoming the first elected representative to cross the floor to a unionist party from the Scottish National Party. She cited a ""toxic and bullying"" culture in her former party that led to her defection.[40][41]
Policies and views[edit]
In line with the Scottish Conservatives, Ross supports British unionism and is opposed to a second referendum on Scottish independence.[42] Following his election as leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, Ross stated that he wanted to represent ""working-class unionists in Scotland.""[43] However, he has also criticised what he views as too much centralisation around London and has expressed support for some federalist ideas, including House of Lords reform.[44] In the run-up to the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Ross proposed a ""pro-UK, anti-referendum coalition"" with other Scottish unionist parties although this was not supported by Scottish Labour.[45]Ross backed Remain during the EU referendum, but after the vote he stated Parliament should complete Brexit to ""deliver the will of the British people"". He voted against Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement at the first round of voting and was absent for the second following his wife going into labour. During the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, Ross initially endorsed Mark Harper before backing Boris Johnson in the final round.[46]Ross has also expressed support for power of recall in the Scottish parliament, and in 2021 proposed what he called ""Mackay's Law"" (named after former SNP Finance Minister Derek Mackay), whereby MSPs who have not shown up for work for over six months but still collect pay must be forced to resign.[43]
Football referee[edit]
A qualified football official, Ross is a top-level assistant referee in his spare time. He was one of the officials for the 2015 Scottish Cup Final, assisting Willie Collum,[47] and the 2018 Scottish Cup Final, assisting Kevin Clancy. He has run the line in several editions of Scotland's biggest club fixture, the Old Firm Derby, and has been involved in continental UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League ties and international FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship qualifiers.[48] He continued his refereeing career after being elected to the Scottish Parliament[49] and also officiated matches whilst an MP in the UK House of Commons.[50]In the House of Commons Register of Members' Interests, Ross declared earnings of more than £2,700 in August and September 2017 for his work as an assistant referee.[16][51] In October of that year, Ross told the football authorities that he would no longer accept refereeing appointments during the week while the UK Parliament is sitting.[18] By December 2017 his declared income from 20 domestic and international games since becoming an MP was more than £11,000.[52]In December 2018, BBC Sport reported that Ross had reduced the number of refereeing appointments due to his work commitments as an MP.[53] At this time, he also argued that the Scottish Football Association should not appoint fully professional referees.[53]In August 2020, Ross apologised for not attending a VJ Day event as a result of previously agreeing to officiate at a Scottish Premiership game between Kilmarnock and St Johnstone. Ross said he would donate his match fee to the charity Help for Heroes.[54] In October 2020, he was a linesman at Wembley for England's 3–0 friendly win against Wales.[55]In November 2020, FIFA were asked to investigate a complaint by a member of the Scottish Football Supporters Association that a Conservative Party leaflet distributed to homes in Scotland included a photograph of Ross as a match official.[56]Ross stopped officiating games in January 2021 due to injury.[57] He resumed his refereeing career in July 2022, while both Holyrood and Westminster were in recess.[57]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married his wife, Krystle, in 2015. They have two sons, one who was born in 2019, and another in 2021.[2][58][59]
Notes[edit]

^ Ross has served as Leader of the Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament since 6 May 2021, having been preceded by Ruth Davidson.

^ Normally, regional MSPs do not have individual predecessors and successors. However, Ross retired his seat during a sitting parliament so was succeeded by Halcro Johnston.

Personal detailsBorn (1954-12-22) 22 December 1954 (age 69)Hitchin, Hertfordshire, EnglandPolitical partyLabourResidence(s)Dumfries, ScotlandAlma materUniversity of Edinburgh, University of CambridgeOccupationPoliticianElaine Kildare Murray (born 22 December 1954) is a retired Scottish Labour politician. She was leader of Dumfries and Galloway Council for the 2017–2022 term. She was also the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Dumfries from 1999 to 2011, and then for Dumfriesshire from 2011 to 2016. At the 1999, 2003 and 2007 elections, Murray increased her percentage share of the vote. She was Shadow Minister for the Environment in the Scottish Parliament.[1] She lost her seat in 2016.
In May 2017, Murray was elected one of four councillors in Dumfries and Galloway who represent the Nith ward and was elected the Group Leader of Labour in the council. She did not stand for re-election in 2022.

Background[edit]
Murray was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, where her Scottish parents lived at the time. She was brought up in Edinburgh, where she was a pupil at The Mary Erskine School,[2] and graduated with an undergraduate degree in chemistry from the University of Edinburgh and a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of Cambridge.
After graduating from Cambridge, Murray first worked in scientific research, and from 1990–93 was an associate lecturer for the Open University.[3] At the same time, she worked for Alex Smith, Member of the European Parliament. In 1994 Murray was elected as a Councillor on Strathclyde Regional Council and in 1995 to South Ayrshire Council, where she was Convenor of Educational Services.[3]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Murray was elected as Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Dumfries constituency following the first Scottish Parliamentary elections in May 1999.[1] She was re-elected in 2003 and then again in 2007, 2011 and 2016.
Murray was appointed Deputy Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport upon Jack McConnell becoming First Minister in 2001, a post she held until 2003. She has been a member of a number of Committees in the Scottish Parliament, including holding the post of Deputy Convenor of the Finance Committee between 2007 and 2008. Murray was Enterprise Spokesman under Wendy Alexander's leadership[1] and upon election of Iain Gray as Leader of the Labour Group in the Scottish Parliament, she was appointed Shadow Minister for the Environment.[1]Murray was a member of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee as well as Convenor of the Cross Party Groups on Science and Technology and Civil Nuclear Energy. She was also Vice-Convenor of the Life Sciences and Animal Welfare Cross Party Groups.[1]In September 2011, Murray announced her candidacy for the deputy leadership of the Scottish Labour Party.[4] She withdrew in early November after failing to gain enough nominations. She claimed she could have got the sufficient number of nominations but said it was clear the Deputy Leadership role would go to a Westminster MP.[5]At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Murray lost her seat to Oliver Mundell, a Conservative.[6][7]
Dumfries and Galloway councillor[edit]
At the 2017 Scottish local elections, Murray stood for election in the Dumfries and Galloway ward of Nith and was elected as one of four councillors for the ward.[8] She later became leader of the council,[9] but announced her retirement from politics in April 2022, saying: ""I want to do other things while I'm still fit and healthy. I have been an elected representative in local or national politics for 27 out of the last 28 years and I feel that's long enough.""[10]

She was previously MSP for the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency from 1999 until 2016.

Early life and career[edit]
Smith was born in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire and attended St Patrick's School, a local co-educational Roman Catholic school. She studied Economics and Politics at Glasgow College and then trained as a Modern Studies and Economics teacher at St Andrews College, a Catholic teacher-training institution in Glasgow. She worked as a secondary school teacher before becoming a local government officer, also gaining a Diploma in Public Sector Management.[1]
Political career[edit]
Smith was elected as a Scottish Labour MSP for her local constituency of Coatbridge and Chryston in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, with a majority of 10,404. She subsequently went on to be returned in 2003, 2007 and 2011, with majorities of 8,571, 4,510 and 2,741 respectively. On 11 May 2011, she was elected to serve as one of two Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament.
In 2013, Smith voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage, claiming at a session of the Equal Opportunities Committee that its introduction could lead to polygamy.[2] Smith was one of three Labour MSPs that voted against the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014.[3]Smith supported Jeremy Corbyn during both the 2015 and 2016 Labour Party leadership elections.[4][5] During the 2016 European Union membership referendum, she backed Britain leaving the European Union, contrary to the position of the Labour Party.[6]In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Smith lost her seat by 3,779 votes after watching her vote share drop by 17.6%.[7] She gained a list seat as one of seven additional members for the Central Scotland region and was returned for the new session. Following the retirement of Tricia Marwick, she attempted to be elected Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. However, she was defeated by Ken Macintosh, a fellow Labour MSP and one of the additional members for the West Scotland region.[8] After standing down as a Deputy Presiding Officer, she became a member of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee.[9]Smith supported Richard Leonard in the 2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election.[10] Following Leonard's victory, she was appointed to his frontbench and was given the new role of Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Eradication of Poverty and Inequality. Her appointment was controversial because of her record of opposing same-sex marriage.[11]In February 2018, Smith invited anti-abortion academic Professor Priscilla K. Coleman to speak at an event in the Scottish Parliament discussing what Coleman believes is the harmful impact of abortion on mental health. After facing criticism from Scottish Labour colleagues, Smith withdrew the invitation, citing a ""diary clash"".[12] In response to the backlash, Richard Leonard said ""It has been made clear to Elaine that she needs to comply with the party’s policy on issues like a woman’s right to choose.""[13]In September 2019, Smith announced she would be standing down at the next Scottish Parliament election on health grounds.[14] Later that month, she became Scottish Labour Parliamentary Business Manager, replacing Neil Findlay.[15]Smith nominated Monica Lennon in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[16] She stood down at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[17]
Personal life[edit]
Smith is a member of the trade unions Unite the Union, formerly Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), and General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTC).[1]

She was Scottish Greens Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Highlands and Islands from 2003–2007, then female co-convener of the party from 2008–2011 with Patrick Harvie.

Early life and education[edit]
Eleanor Roberta Ettles was born in Inverness on 23 July 1951. Her parents were Roberta (née Reid) and William Ettles. She educated at Bearsden Academy, and studied medicine at the University of Glasgow, graduating with a MBChB in 1974.[2][1]

She worked as a community paediatrician in Inverness 1980−87 and in Ross and Cromarty 1987−2003, providing a service for special needs children in the Scottish Highlands.[2][3]Since joining the Scottish Green Party in 1989, Scott has campaigned on many issues, most recently against the building of new incinerators, GM crops in the Black Isle and the movement against war in Iraq.
In 1999, the Scottish Green Party selected her at the top of its regional list for the Highlands and Islands, although it did not gain a seat in that region.[4] The same year she was also selected to stand as a Scottish Green Party candidate for the Scotland European Parliament election, the Party did not win any of the six seats.[5] She stood unsuccessfully for the United Kingdom Parliament for Ross, Skye and Inverness West in the 2001 election[6] and again in 2010 when the Scottish Green Party fielded candidates in 20 constituencies across Scotland.[7][8]

She was Party spokesperson for health, and from June 2005, also spokesperson on rural development.[11]She stood again in the 2007 Scottish election, and was not re-elected.[12]In September 2008, she was involved in a leadership contest against Nina Baker and Maggie Chapman.[13][14] Scott was elected to the position of co-convener of the Scottish Green Party alongside Patrick Harvie,[15] a position she held until 2011.
For the 2011 election she was again placed at the top of the Scottish Green Party's regional list for the Highlands and Islands,[16] however the Party were unsuccessful in gaining a seat in the region. The following year she participated in the Yes Highland meetings ahead of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.[17]

Personal detailsBornStranraer, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyEmma Harper is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician.  She has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South Scotland region since the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[1]
Early life[edit]
Harper was born and raised on a farm near Stranraer where her father was a dairyman. She attended Stranraer Academy. In 1978, the family moved to a farm near Annan and she attended Annan Academy prior to her nurse training in Dumfries at the Royal College of Nursing and Midwifery.[2] After qualifying, she worked at the Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.[3]Harper has worked in hospitals in NHS Scotland and NHS England, and at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, United States. Her work included: transplant and trauma surgery, before going on to lead nursing surgical teams and provide specialist clinical education.[2]Harper is a degree-registered nurse and a member of the Royal College of Nursing and the Association for Perioperative Practice.
As a keen Burnsian, Harper is past president of Dumfries Ladies Burns Club Number 1.

Political career[edit]
Harper joined the SNP in 2010.[2]In 2015 she stood for the UK Parliament as SNP candidate for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale & Tweeddale. She finished second and achieved a huge swing of +27.5% of the vote for the SNP, narrowly losing the seat by only 798 votes.[4]In 2016 she was elected MSP to the Scottish Parliament for South Scotland (region), and was deputy convenor to the Health and Sport Committee and member of the Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee.[5]In 2019 she downplayed the issues around creating a new currency in an independent Scotland to a BBC audience, remarking that her recent holiday to Mexico demonstrated that, ""plastic translates anywhere where you are""; she then claimed Scottish issued bank notes were currently being exchanged for more than English ones on the foreign exchange markets, which indicated that (in the future) ""Our Scottish pounds have the propensity to be really really strong"".[6][7][8]She was the top SNP candidate on the regional list in South Scotland at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[9]During the campaign she courted controversy when she told ITV that a hard border between an independent Scotland and England would bring opportunities, insisting: ""We can show that a border will work, there are issues that have been brought to my attention that show that jobs can be created if a border is created.""[10] Her party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, disavowed the remarks and claimed: ""I've not seen Emma's comments directly but nobody in the SNP wants to see a border between Scotland and England.""[10] In an opinion piece for The Scotsman, former Labour MP Brian Wilson remarked of the controversy: ""First, in the real world, Scotland does more trade with Yorkshire than with China. Second, Ms Harper is a star in the SNP firmament, placed top of their regional list and a racing cert to return to Holyrood. Ye gods.""[11]Harper was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2021.

Personal detailsBorn (1997-07-30) 30 July 1997 (age 26)Political partyScottish National PartyEmma Roddick (born 30 July 1997) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician serving as the Minister for Equalities, Migration and Refugees since 2023.[1] She has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Highlands and Islands since May 2021.

Early life[edit]
Roddick was born to Sue, a social worker, and Davy Roddick and lived in Alness from an early age.[2] Both of her parents had died by the time she was elected in May 2021. She formerly worked for the Scottish Ambulance Service.[3]Roddick, who has Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and PTSD,[4] started a petition in 2017 to improve the available services from Scotland's NHS24 helpline.[5] In 2020 the campaign proved successful, and NHS 24 added option 3 to their service.[6]
Political career[edit]
In November 2019 she was elected in a by-election as a Councillor, representing the Inverness Central ward of the Highland Council.[7] Shortly after starting her campaign, she became the target of mostly anonymous online death and rape threats,[8] and had her home broken into twice.[9] The month before, she refused to sign a petition opposing the Gender Recognition Act reforms, claiming the petition had ""transphobic undertones"".[10][9]On 8 May 2021 she was elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Highlands and Islands.[11] She was one of the youngest candidates seeking election, and the youngest MSP elected.[12][13]After her election in 2021, Roddick, who had been homeless in the past, spoke about the financial burdens of running for office which provide barriers to young and working-class people running,[13] and highlighted the initial cost of being an MSP.[14]In 2023, she was appointed to the Yousaf government as Minister for Equalities, Migration and Refugees.[15]
Personal life[edit]
Roddick plays the fiddle.[16] She lives in Merkinch in Inverness[17] and identifies as bisexual.[18][19]

He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 1999: for Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber from 1999 to 2011, and for Inverness and Nairn since 2011.

Background[edit]
Ewing is the son of the veteran Scottish nationalist Winnie Ewing, who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons, as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), and an MSP. His father was an SNP local councillor.  He has long been active in the Scottish National Party.
Educated at Loretto School, in Musselburgh, he read Law at the University of Glasgow[2] where he was a member of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association. His late wife, Margaret Ewing, was the MSP for the neighbouring constituency of Moray until her death from breast cancer in March 2006. His sister, Annabelle Ewing, was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth until the 2005 general election and has been the MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife since 2011.
He is now in a relationship with Dr. Fiona Pearsall with whom he had a daughter in 2008.[3]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Ewing was elected to represent Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber in the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and he held on to the seat in 2003[4] and 2007.[5]He and his mother, Winnie Ewing both abstained from the vote to abolish Section 28[6] via the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000; he also opposed an outright ban on fox hunting. After the SNP's victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, Ewing was appointed as the Minister for Community Safety. After the SNP victory at the 2011 Scottish Parliament Election, he was appointed as the Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, succeeding Jim Mather who stood down as an MSP. In February 2014 he voted against the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Scotland.[7] In November 2014 the portfolio became Business Energy & Tourism.
In 2019 civil servants complained to senior managers that Ewing had bullied them. Speaking to journalists Ewing said: ""I completely reject all claims against me. A process is underway and that is entirely right and proper when such allegations are made. That process is at an early stage. I will make no further comment while that process is ongoing.""[8][9] The previous year Ewing apologised to an official for his ""forthright"" manner, after a bullying complaint was lodged against him.[10][11]After the 2021 election Ewing was replaced as a minister by Mairi Gougeon and became a backbencher. In a public letter to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Ewing revealed: ""In our discussion yesterday, you indicated that you will form a slimmed down cabinet. Obviously, you have had to make some tough decisions and we agreed that this meant I should now step out of Government.""[12]In 2022 Ewing backed new oil and gas exploration and drilling projects in the North Sea, claiming that ""we need all oil and gas production we can get in the short and the medium term"", and that ""the transition period away from hydrocarbons will last decades.""[13] Hence, he condemned the Scottish Greens, the SNP's government partners, whose policies he described as ""somewhat extreme"".[14] On 20 April 2023, after a particularly robust intervention from Ewing on the subject of gas extraction, he was reminded officially about treating fellow members with respect by the Presiding Officer, which happened to be his sister, Annabelle Ewing. First Minister Humza Yousaf then quipped that he suspected it was not the first time she had had to tell her brother off.[15]Ewing voted against Green minister Lorna Slater in a no-confidence vote on 20 June 2023, making him the only SNP MSP to do so.[16][17] It was reported the next day in the Herald and Scotsman that Ewing was set to lose the whip for this.[18][19] Later that day, his mother, died age 93, hailed as a ""SNP political icon"".[20] Yousaf said publicly that Ewing would not lose the whip, despite his repeated public criticism of the party,[21] but it was announced on 14 September that SNP MSPs would vote on disciplinary action against him.[22] The SNP members voted to suspend him from the SNP Group for one week, but on 1 October he announced he would appeal the suspension.

Personal detailsBornFiona Jane Hyslop (1964-08-01) 1 August 1964 (age 59)Irvine, Ayrshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySpouseKenneth Anderson (m.1994)Children3Alma materUniversity of GlasgowHeriot-Watt UniversityOccupationSales and marketing executiveWebsitehttp://www.fionahyslop.com/Fiona Jane Hyslop (born 1 August 1964) is a Scottish politician who has served as Minister for Transport since 2023.[1] She previously served in various cabinet and junior ministerial offices under first ministers Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon; first as education secretary from 2007 to 2009, then culture secretary from 2011 to 2020, and latterly as economy secretary from 2020 to 2021.[2][3]  A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Linlithgow constituency since 2011, having represented the Lothians region from 1999 to 2011.
Hyslop was born in Ayrshire and spent her early years in England, before moving back to Scotland. She attended the University of Glasgow, where she earned a Masters of Art in Economic History and Sociology. She moved to Edinburgh and worked for the Standard Life Assurance Company.[4] Hyslop joined the SNP in 1986 and spent her spare time campaigning in local elections. She unsuccessfully stood for the British House of Commons for both the Edinburgh Leith and Edinburgh Central constituencies in the 90s. In 1999, she was elected to the Scottish Parliament as an additional member for the Lothian regions.
After the SNP's election victory in 2007, Hyslop was appointed by First Minister Alex Salmond as Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, but was later sacked following threats of a motion of no confidence in 2009.[5] She was demoted to junior Minister for Culture and External Affairs, which was later promoted to cabinet-level in 2011. She served as Culture Secretary from 2011 to 2020, where she then added economy on to her portfolio, as Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture. In 2021, following First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's cabinet reshuffle, she announced her intention to step down, having served 14 years in government.[6]
Early life[edit]
Childhood and education[edit]
Fiona Jane Hyslop[7] was born in Irvine, Ayrshire, on 1 August 1964.[8] At the age of three she moved to Grantham, England, where it made her feel Scotland was a ""distinct country"".[4] Her father died at a young age and her mother, a midwife, was left as a single parent to two children. Following the death of Hyslop's father, her family returned to Ayrshire where she attended Alloway Primary School and later Ayr Academy. In the 1970s, she began to have an interest in politics through her mother's friends, who were members of the Scottish National Party.[9]When Hyslop was 14, her mother married her step-father, a general practitioner, who had two children. Her step-brother was hospital catering manager and her step-sister was in the police, giving Hyslop a real sense of the importance of public services.[4] Her political awareness was enhanced in the 1980s, during the Thatcher years, to what she describes as the years Margaret Thatcher ""attacked"" public services.[10]Hyslop studied social sciences at the University of Glasgow and earned an Masters of Art in Economic History and Sociology. She also earned a Post-graduate Diploma in Industrial Administration from the Scottish College of Textiles. She moved to Edinburgh, where she worked for the Standard Life Assurance Company from 1986 to 1999.[11]
Early political activism[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait of Hyslop, 1999Hyslop meets Andrew Mitchell and David Mundell outside St. Andrew's HouseHyslop helped campaign for the Scottish National Party at a local by-election even though she was not a member. In 1986, she eventually joined the Scottish National Party. She described herself as never being a ""joiner"" and joined the SNP after she read their manifesto, and felt that Scottish independence most suited her interests. She became the party's election agent for three regional candidates in the 1988 Scottish local elections and managed to win a seat.[4]Whilst working in Edinburgh, Hyslop spent her spare time campaigning for the SNP and was an active member of the Young Scots Nationalists, the SNP's youth wing. She worked along with Charlie Reid of the Proclaimers and Angus Robertson. She worked on motions to move the SNP to a more centre-left, social democratic party. Hyslop became Vice Convener for Policy and served on the SNP Executive Committee.[4]Hyslop stood as a candidate in the 1988 Edinburgh District Council elections, and in the 1990 and 1994 Lothian Regional Council elections. She also stood as candidate for Edinburgh Leith and Edinburgh Central in the 1992 and 1997 UK General Elections respectively.[11]
Political career[edit]
SNP in opposition; 1999-2007[edit]
Following the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament, Hyslop stood on the SNP's additional list for the Lothian region and was elected in 1999.[12] Her first years as Member of the Scottish Parliament, strengthened her views on Scottish independence after seeing the lack of powers the parliament really had.[4]
In 2003, Hyslop sought re-election to the 2nd Scottish Parliament, this time as a candidate for the Linlithgow constituency. Although she failed to win this constituency, she was re-elected from the Lothian regional list.[13] She felt frustrated by the lack of influence the parliament had over the Iraq war and believed Scotland's place in the world ""would be far better strengthened by independence.""[4]Hyslop, once again, stood for the Linlithgow constituency in the 2007 election. She lost the seat, again, but increased her vote share and retained her seat on the Lothian list.[14]
Education Secretary; 2007-2009[edit]
The SNP formed a minority government following the 2007 election, with Alex Salmond as First Minister. Salmond appointed Hyslop to his cabinet as the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, a portfolio she had previously shadowed. As Education Secretary, she passed the Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Act 2008, an Act of the Scottish Parliament to abolish the graduate endowment, and the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009, which made provisions in relation to additional support needs. Hyslop in Japan, 2015In December 2009, opposition parties called for Hyslop to be sacked, as Scottish Labour Leader Iain Gray stated that schools were in ""crisis"". Labour threatened to motion a vote of no-confidence. With an SNP minority government, this made Hyslop almost certain to be ousted from office. Instead, Salmond sacked her from cabinet and she was demoted to a junior minister post of Minister for Culture and External Affairs.[15]In 2011 election to the 3rd Scottish parliament, Hyslop ran, again, for the Linlithgow constituency. After running twice, she successfully defeated Scottish Labour's Mary Mulligan, gaining the constituency.[16]
Culture Secretary; 2009-2020[edit]
Following the SNP's landslide victory in the 2011 election, she was promoted back to cabinet in Salmond's second government as Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs.[17] In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, she campaigned in favour of Scottish independence. 

Hyslop speaking at Scottish Government press conference, 2020Following the defeat of the Yes campaign in the referendum, Salmond resigned as First Minister and leader of the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Salmond and Hyslop remained in Sturgeon's new cabinet. She added Europe onto her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Europe and External Affairs. In the 2016 EU Referendum, she campaigned to remain within the European Union, as she stated there would be 'huge economic uncertainty'.[18] In 2020, she added economy onto her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture.

Backbencher; 2021-2022[edit]
Hyslop was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2021 election.[19] Prior to Nicola Sturgeon's cabinet reshuffle, she announced that she would stand down from government, having served 14 years.[20][21] As a backbencher, she served as Deputy Convener of the Scottish Parliament's Economy and Fair Work Committee and was a member of the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee.

Transport Minister; 2023-present[edit]
In June 2023, she was appointed as the junior Minister for Transport, after Kevin Stewart's resignation.[1][22]
Personal life[edit]
Hyslop lives in Linlithgow with her husband and their three children.[4] She met her husband, Kenneth Anderson, through the SNP and the couple married in 1994.[10]

Personal detailsBorn (1957-12-03) 3 December 1957 (age 66)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materGlasgow UniversityStrathclyde UniversityProfessionLibrarianFiona Grace McLeod (born 3 December 1957) is a Scottish politician who served as acting Minister for Children and Young People from 2014 to 2015. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Strathkelvin and Bearsden constituency from 2011 to 2016, having previously represented the West of Scotland region from 1999 to 2003.

Background[edit]
She was born on 3 December 1957 in Glasgow, Scotland. She studied History at University of Glasgow, before gaining a Postgraduate Diploma in Librarianship at University of Strathclyde. She worked as a librarian at Glasgow North College of Nursing and the Marie Curie Huntershill Hospice. She was appointed to Ofcom's Scottish Advisory Committee from 2004 to 2006, and was a founding member of Westerton Junior Youth Club.

Scottish Parliament[edit]
In the 1999 election she stood as a constituency candidate in Strathkelvin and Bearsden, where she was runner-up to Labour candidate Sam Galbraith.[1] She had been placed fourth on the SNP's West of Scotland list, and was elected as a MSP through this route.[2] She served as Deputy Party Spokesperson on the Environment.[3]Galbraith resigned his seat in 2001 but McLeod did not stand in the subsequent by-election as this would have meant resigning her seat. However she did contest the seat in the 2003 election but finished fourth, behind Jean Turner (an independent), Brian Fitzpatrick (who had won the by-election) and Jo Swinson (who would later become MP for part of the seat). She also only placed 7th on the SNP list for West of Scotland and so also lost her top-up place in parliament.
In the 2011 Scottish Parliament general election she won the constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden following the SNP landslide victory, defeating David Whitton on a swing of 7.7%.
She served as acting Minister for Children and Young People, from 18 December 2014 until 31 August 2015,[4] during Aileen Campbell MSP's maternity leave. This was the first time that a Minister of the Scottish Government had taken maternity leave.[5]In May 2015, Mcleod announced that she would not be standing for re-election to Parliament the following year.[6]
After Parliament[edit]
In 2004, she became one of the first members of Ofcom's Advisory Committee for Scotland.[7]In November 2016 she was announced as a member of the Commission on Parliamentary Reform, having been nominated to represent the SNP.[8]In August 2017, the Scottish Book Trust appointed her as a member of its Board of Trustees.[9]

McLeod is married with one son.[10]

Personal detailsBorn (1969-01-05) 5 January 1969 (age 55)Nabiganj, Habiganj, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)Political partyScottish LabourRelativesWali Tasar Uddin (uncle)Foysol Hussain Choudhury, MBE (Bengali: ফয়সল হোসেন চৌধূরী; born 5 January 1969) is a Bangladeshi-born British businessman, and a Scottish Labour politician.  He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothian region since May 2021.
Choudhury is Chairman of the Edinburgh and Lothians Regional Equality Council. He is one of the founding directors and the Vice Chair of the Edinburgh Mela. He is also Chairman of the Bangladesh Samity Edinburgh.

Early life[edit]
Choudhury was born on 5 January 1969 to the Bengali Muslim Choudhury family of Badardi in Nabiganj, Habiganj, Sylhet district, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). He is the eldest child of Al-Haj Ghulam Rabbani Choudhury and Ruqeya Rabbani Choudhury. and has one brother and five sisters.[1] His father came and settled in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1982 with his family.[2] Choudhury's uncle is businessman Wali Tasar Uddin.[3]
Career[edit]
During his time studying at the University of Edinburgh, Choudhury took responsibility for his ailing father's business. He expanded the business and is now an entrepreneur with interests in catering, hospitality, finance and real estate across the United Kingdom and Bangladesh.[1]Choudhury is a community activist in the UK. He has worked with the Scottish Government and various councils to improve community relations. He has played a leading role in several charities.[1]He has been involved with the Edinburgh and Lothian's Regional Equality Council (ELREC) since he was a teenager and has been an active campaigner for equality and good race and interfaith relations in Scotland. He has served the ELREC as a Trustee, company secretary, Vice Chair and he is currently its chairman. Choudhury has led the organisation through its transition from the race equality council to a pan-equalities regional council.[1][4][5][6] In 2013, he was re-elected for a fourth term.[3]In 1991,[3] Choudhury co-founded the Edinburgh Mela[3] and is currently its vice-chair. In 2010,[1] he was elected as the Chairman of the Bangladesh Samity Edinburgh (Bangladesh Association Edinburgh).[3] He has organised, annually, Bangladesh Independence Day Celebrations and other events to promote strong community relations.[1] Choudhury is the Chairman of the Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs of Scotland and as one of the founding members of Dine Bangladeshi Campaign.[1]At the snap 2017 general election, Choudhury was selected as the official Labour Party candidate for the Edinburgh South West constituency. However, he was not elected and finished in third place with 13,213 votes.[7]He was elected at 2021 Scottish Parliament election for the Lothian region, becoming the first MSP of Bangladeshi background to be elected.[8][9]
Criticism[edit]
On 11 June 2019, an article in the Edinburgh Evening News reported criticism of Mr Choudhury by an employment tribunal. The tribunal, brought by former Mela director Chris Purnell, found that evidence given by Mr Choudhury was unsatisfactory. The tribunal said Mr Purnell had given his evidence “in a straightforward and measured way” and it was “entirely credible”. It added: “In contrast, the manner in which Mr Khan and Mr Choudhury gave their evidence was often unsatisfactory. Both showed a reluctance to answer simple questions directly.”
The tribunal awarded Mr Purnell £67,000 after it found he was unfairly dismissed from his role of director of the Mela festival, of which Mr Choudhury was vice-chair. Mr Purnell alleged that Mr Choudhury told him he should “watch himself” and “remember who pays his wages”. And he said Mr Choudhury also criticised his body language and told him “directors come and go” and that he should not be taking credit for the success of the Mela and “acting as if he was doing the board a favour”.
The 2016 Mela was cancelled but the festival went ahead in scaled-back form in 2017 and 2018. The council has invited tenders to run a multicultural event in the summer of 2019.
Choudhury also faced some criticism for benefitting from the zipping system of candidate ranking.[10] The system is intended to promote female candidates by alternating between male and female candidates. In the Lothian region selection ballot Choudhury finished in fifth place but thanks to the zipping system was promoted to third place ahead of two female candidates who achieved greater support.[11]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2004, Choudhury was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours[3] for his services to the community.[1] In 2006, he was awarded from the Channel S Award for his outstanding role as community worker and leader.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Choudhury is married Tahmina (Moni) Choudhury.[1]He is involved in fundraising campaigns, raising over £250,000 for causes including Bangladesh Cyclone Appeal in Scotland, St Colombia's Hospice, Leukaemia and Cancer appeal, Sick Kids appeal, the British Heart Foundation and many others. In addition to this he is also one of the organisers who built two shelter and 40 houses for the survivors of Cyclone Sidr Bangladesh in 2010.[1]

Personal detailsBorn (1961-05-21) 21 May 1961 (age 62)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Socialist PartySpousenoneChildren1 sonResidence(s)Partick, ScotlandFrances Curran (born 21 May 1961) is a former co-chair of the Scottish Socialist Party.  She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland region from 2003 to 2007.[1]
Political career[edit]
A former member of the Labour Party and an organiser for the entryist Militant group,[2] Curran became a high-profile figure in Scottish left politics on her election to the Scottish Parliament as a Scottish Socialist Party MSP in 2003. She had joined the SSP on its formation in 1998, and brought political experience she had gained while she served as the youth representative on Labour's National Executive Committee.
In July 2005, Curran played a role in organising the protest outside Gleneagles at the 2005 G8 Summit.[3] The previous week, she and other SSP MSPs took part in a protest within the Scottish Parliament, which led to them being suspended for the month of September and fined £30,000.[4] This protest was due to their claim that the First Minister had gone back on his word that the parliament would support the rally outside the Perthshire hotel.
Curran was the public face of the SSP's campaign for the provision of nutritious free school meals, which they said would tackle ill health and poor diet in Scottish schoolchildren. Her campaign drew a wide base of support from a number of children's and health charities. As part of the Save Our Services campaign, she was involved in community occupations to stop the closure of a school and community centre. In 2007, she was arrested but not charged at an anti-nuclear protest at Faslane as part of the Faslane 365 campaign.[5]She was an unsuccessful candidate in the July 2008 Glasgow East by-election.[6] During the campaign, she was informed that the police had received death threats against her.[7]She stood again as a candidate on the Glasgow regional list for the Holyrood election in 2011, but failed to be elected. She had stepped down as the party's national co-spokesperson less than a month before the election.
Curran was elected to the SSP's Executive Committee in 2012 but stood down again in 2013, keeping a low profile throughout the party's referendum campaign. She was elected as party co-chair alongside Bill Bonnar at the 2014 conference,[8] but withdrew her nomination for the position on the day of the 2015 conference seven months later.  She was re-elected to the SSP executive at its 2016 conference.
At the 2018 conference she stood for national spokesperson, but lost to Róisín McLaren.  She remains an ordinary member of the executive committee.

Personal detailsBorn (1962-07-27) 27 July 1962 (age 61)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourAlma materUniversity of Strathclyde, University of GlasgowOccupationTeacher (English and History)Frank McAveety (born 27 July 1962) is a Scottish Labour Party politician who served as Leader of Glasgow City Council from 2015 to 2017. He has been a councillor for the Shettleston ward of Glasgow. He was previously the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow Shettleston constituency from 1999 to 2011.[1]
Early life[edit]
McAveety was born 27 July 1962 in Glasgow and brought up in the city's Barmulloch district.[2] He was educated in Glasgow at All Saints Secondary School,[2] followed by the University of Strathclyde, from which he graduated in 1983, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and History.
After receiving a Postgraduate Certificate in Education from St Andrew's College of Education (now part of the University of Glasgow) in 1984, McAveety began a career as a secondary school teacher. He taught English at schools across the South side and the East End of Glasgow.

Political career[edit]
Glasgow councillor[edit]
He was a member of Glasgow District Council from 1988 until 1996 and served as Convenor of the Arts and Culture Committee, which developed the Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art and initiated plans for the large-scale redevelopment of Kelvingrove Gallery in Glasgow.
McAveety served as Leader of the Glasgow City Council from 1997 until 1999, during which time he initiated the largest-ever investment package for Glasgow Secondary Schools and oversaw the removal of housing debt for City Housing Tenants[citation needed]. He also established the first ever Local Authority Standards Committee, which was the influence for the establishment of the Standards Commission for Scotland by the Scottish Parliament, a few years later.

Scottish Parliament[edit]
When elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, he was appointed Deputy Minister for Local Government in the Scottish Executive and served in that position until 2000. He returned to office as Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care in May 2002. As Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport following the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, he established the National Theatre of Scotland, which has resulted in the award-winning play, Black Watch and other productions. In his capacity as Sports Minister, McAveety advocated using sports investment as an opportunity for community regeneration and he oversaw Scotland's largest ever investment in national sports infrastructure, being developed in the East End of Glasgow. He also conducted a successful campaign to bring the headquarters of Sportscotland, the national sports agency, to the East End of Glasgow.
In 2004, he was mocked by a Sheriff Court judge after charges against two anti-war protesters were dropped after an altercation with the two protesters and a Labour council candidate.[3] McAveety had claimed they had put him through the ""worst intimidation in his life"" during an altercation in the southside of Glasgow. In dismissing the case however, Sheriff Graeme Warner said that McAveety ""must have lived a very sheltered life"" and had ""completely blown his credibility"".[4]A week later, he was forced to apologise for misleading parliament when he turned up late for a ministerial question time claiming to have been unavoidably detained on ministerial business. It was later discovered that he was actually eating pie, beans and roast potatoes in the parliament canteen.[5] The incident was dubbed by some as ""porky pie-gate"" and is said to have led First Minister Jack McConnell to sack him from his cabinet later that year.[6]McAveety was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament on 3 May 2007 after winning more than 50% of the vote in Glasgow Shettleston and until June 2010 he served as Convener of the Public Petitions Committee and was the Scottish Labour Party's Shadow Minister for Sport.
On 16 June 2010 he resigned as Convenor of the Scottish Parliament's Public Petitions Committee after being overheard making comments about the physical appearance of a female member of the audience during a break in committee proceedings.[7] The comments were broadcast because he had not switched off his microphone.[8] McAveety said: ""There's a very attractive girl in the second row, dark... and dusky. We'll maybe put a wee word out for her.""[7]McAveety led a campaign in 2009 to establish access for children free of charge to professional football matches in Scotland. He is a keen supporter of Celtic F.C. and the Scotland national team and, while an MSP, was a regular player for the Scottish Parliamentary Football Team, which has taken part in a number of high-profile charity events.
McAveety is known for his knowledge of various genres of modern popular music.[9] He has written in praise of David Bowie in the Scotsman newspaper and he wrote a regular feature for Holyrood Magazine, which celebrated and recommended his favourite albums. In April 2005, the Scotsman newspaper dubbed him the ""Daddy of Parliamentary Pop"". This was in reference to his speech in the Parliamentary Chamber in support of a motion recognising Franz Ferdinand for that band's contribution to Scottish popular music and culture.
McAveety has served as a board member for the Arches Theatre Company in Glasgow, Enterprise Scotland and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. From January 2009 he served on the boards of the Scottish Youth Theatre and Fields in Trust Scotland (formerly National Playing Fields Association).
In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, he lost his seat to the SNP's John Mason[10] but he made an early return to politics in May 2012, when he was elected as a Councillor for the Shettleston ward of Glasgow City Council.[11]On 10 September 2015, McAveety was elected leader of Glasgow City Council after Gordon Matheson stood down, thus returning to a post he had held sixteen years earlier.[12] He was succeeded by Susan Aitken on 4 May 2017.[13]

Personal detailsBorn1980 (age 43–44)[1]Airdrie, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materUniversity of StrathclydeUniversity of EdinburghFulton James MacGregor MSP (born 1980) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the constituency of Coatbridge and Chryston since 2016. He serves on the Justice and Education & Skills committees in the Scottish Parliament.[2]
Early life[edit]
MacGregor attended Coatbridge High School before going on to gain degrees in Psychology and in Social Work from the University of Strathclyde and the University of Edinburgh.

Political career[edit]
MacGregor stood as an SNP candidate in the North Lanarkshire Council election in 2012 and was elected as one of four councillors for the Coatbridge North and Glenboig ward.
In August 2015 MacGregor was selected by the SNP as their local candidate to contest the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. In an acrimonious internal selection process, party members chose MacGregor ahead of five other candidates. A small minority of branch members then unsuccessfully attempted to have MacGregor de-selected as a candidate.[3] In February 2016 the Coatbridge and Chryston Branch was suspended entirely by the SNP, until the election had passed.[4] Branch members later went as far as to plan a silent protest at the 2016 SNP party conference held in Glasgow in March.[3] In a secret recording of one meeting, MacGregor was heard stating that the internal fighting was making him ""physically sick"".[5] During the campaign MacGregor was branded as 'no show', a name initially coined by journalist Tom Gordon in reference to him not attending a hustings.[6]On 6 May 2016, MacGregor was elected as the first SNP MSP for Coatbridge and Chryston.[7] He retained the seat in the 2021 election with an increased majority and 57% of the vote share.[8]

Personal detailsBornWick, Highland, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySpouseStuart RossGail Elizabeth Ross is a former Scottish National Party (SNP) politician, who served as the  Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Caithness, Sutherland and Ross from the election in May 2016 up until 2021 when she decided to not seek re-election. She was a councillor on the Highland Council 2011–2016, and civic leader of Caithness 2012–2016.

Early life[edit]
Ross grew up in Reiss and Wick, Caithness.[1] She studied in Glasgow, first a combination of advertising and PR, later English and psychology.[2]
Political career[edit]
She joined the SNP in 1997.[2] She was first elected to Highland council in a by-election in 2011.[3] At the time her success was considered a breakthrough for the SNP.[4][5] She was re-elected in May 2012.[6]
Civic leader[edit]
In May 2012, following re-election to Highland Council, she became the civic leader of Caithness.[7]In August 2015, Ross spoke out against the Grindadráp, a Faroese traditional celebration of whaling, suggesting that on account of this that Wick should reconsider their twinning arrangement with the town of Klaksvík.[8] Ross wrote to the mayor of Klaksvík to raise her concerns that the whaling was not something that Wick should be associated with.[9] In January 2016 the matter was brought to the Highland Council,[10] which led to an intervention from Klaksvík's mayor.[11] The council deferred making a decision.[12]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
In August 2015, Ross was announced as the SNP candidate for Caithness, Sutherland and Ross in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, in place of the retiring Rob Gibson.[13] During her time in Holyrood, she called for increased provision of ambulances in Caithness[14] and highlighted the need for affordable housing in the Highlands.[2] In May 2016 she was elected with a majority of 3,913.[15]
The following month she was elected as the deputy convener of the Rural Affairs and Connectivity Committee.[16]In February 2020, Ross announced that she would not be standing for reelection in the next election, citing her wish to spend more time with her family.[17]In November 2016 she resigned her position on Highland council after other Caithness councillors called for an independent review into the introduction of midwife-led maternity services in their area made by NHS Highland. Ross supported the decision by NHS Highland to proceed with the reconfiguration to a Community Maternity Unit (CMU) at Caithness General Hospital, which had been recommended on safety grounds following a review.[18]
Executive positions[edit]
She is a member of the board of North Highland College.[19]
Personal life[edit]
She is married to a teacher and they have a son together.[1] Ross has worked as a model, posing as the muses depicted on the glass engraved trophy awarded to winners of the Mastermind television quiz.[20]

Early life[edit]
Early years[edit]
George James Adam was born on 8 June 1969 in Elderslie, Renfrewshire, in western Scotland. When Adam was nine, his father's business went into receivership which resulted in a complete change in his family’s lifestyle with Adam moving out of his family home to share a home in Glenburn, Paisley with his fathers cousin and finally the family living in a caravan. Adam's father left the family home twice, with George being told by his mother that he was ""the man of the house"". .[1]In the 1980s, Adam's family moved to South Africa for a ""fresh start""; he was angered by the decision due to his success in the youth team at St Mirren F.C. His father's business ""turned sour"" and the family returned to Scotland two years later. They lived in Adam's grandfather's home, where he slept on the sofa.[1] In his late teens, Adam worked for his father's business before working in the motor industry as a Corporate Sales Manager.[2]
Early political years[edit]
Adam joined the Scottish National Party at the age of 17 and has been an active member in Paisley since the late 1980s. In the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, he stood as the SNP candidate in Paisley North but was not successful, with Labour holding the seat.[3]Adam was elected to the Paisley South ward of Renfrewshire Council in the 2007 Scottish local elections.

He held the position of Parliamentary Liaison Officer (PLO) to the Cabinet Secretary Communities, Social Security and Equalities. As he was a member of the Social Security Committee, in September 2016 a decision was taken for him not to also act as an aide, to avoid potential conflict of interest.[8]Adam was the Convenor of the Cross Party Group on Multiple Sclerosis (MS), was the Co-Convenor of the Cross Party Group (CPG) on Fair Trade and was a member of the following CPGs  – Adult Learning, Aviation, Carers and Epilepsy.[9] He is also the patron for Disability Equality Scotland, a charity based in Alloa, that promotes full access and inclusion for disabled people in Scotland.[10]Adam was re-elected in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election with an increased majority of 6,075.[11] He was appointed by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as junior Minister for Parliamentary Business.

Personal detailsBornGeorge Foulkes (1942-01-21) 21 January 1942 (age 81)Oswestry, Shropshire, EnglandPolitical partyLabour and Co-operativeSpouseElizabeth Anna Hope ​(m. 1970)​Children3Alma materUniversity of EdinburghGeorge Foulkes, Baron Foulkes of Cumnock PC (born 21 January 1942) is a British politician and life peer who served as Minister of State for Scotland from 2001 to 2002. A member of the Scottish Labour Party and Co-operative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, formerly South Ayrshire, from 1979 to 2005. He was later a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), as one of the additional members for the Lothians region, from 2007 to 2011.
Born in Shropshire in England, Foulkes was educated at Keith Grammar School in Moray and privately at The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School near London, and studied Psychology at the University of Edinburgh. He served as President of the Scottish Union of Students before being elected to City of Edinburgh District Council and Lothian Regional Council. After unsuccessfully contesting Edinburgh West in 1970 and Edinburgh Pentlands in October 1974, he was elected to represent South Ayrshire in parliament at the 1979 general election and to represent Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley at the 1983 general election following boundary changes.
Appointed to the opposition frontbench in 1983, Foulkes served as a shadow Europe minister, shadow foreign and Commonwealth affairs minister and shadow defence minister respectively. He was forced to resign from the latter role in 1993, after striking a police officer and being convicted of being drunk and disorderly. He rejoined the frontbench in 1994 as a shadow overseas aid minister. After the Labour Party won the 1997 general election, he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development from 1997 to 2001 and Minister of State for Scotland from 2001 to 2002. He stepped down from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election.
While serving as a delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Foulkes joined the House of Lords in June 2005 and was appointed to the Privy Council in July. Elected at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election on the Lothians regional list, he was critical of the conduct of the minority Scottish National Party (SNP) government and campaigned for presumed consent for organ donation. He stood down from the Scottish Parliament at the 2011 election. In the Lords, he continued to be loyal to the New Labour government and supported the ongoing Iraq War and proposals for mandatory identity cards. During the 2009 expenses controversy, he accused presenters who questioned MPs' expenses of undermining democracy. He was a critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for failing to tackle antisemitism in the party and made calls for Richard Leonard to resign as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.

Early life and career[edit]
Foulkes was born in Oswestry, Shropshire, and raised in Banffshire, later Moray, where he was educated at the state secondary Keith Grammar School. He later attended the independent, fee-paying Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in West Hampstead.[1][2] He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where he was Senior President of the Students' Representative Council in 1963. He later became the full-time President of the Scottish Union of Students, after which he was elected as a City of Edinburgh district councillor for the Sighthill ward and then as a member of Lothian Regional Council.[1]
House of Commons[edit]
Before gaining election to the House of Commons, Foulkes unsuccessfully contested Edinburgh West in 1970, being beaten by the Conservative Party candidate Anthony Stodart. In October 1974, he stood for Edinburgh Pentlands but was beaten by Malcolm Rifkind. He was first elected in the 1979 general election, as Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament for South Ayrshire. After the constituency's abolition in boundary changes, he was elected in the 1983 general election for the new constituency of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.
In 1981, Foulkes drafted a political bill called the ""Control of Space Invaders (and other Electronic Games) Bill"" in an attempt to ban the game for its ""addictive properties"" and for causing ""deviancy"". The bill was debated and only narrowly defeated in parliament by 114 to 94 votes.[3][4] He introduced the first-ever proposals for a smoking ban in public places in 1982 and legislation against age discrimination in 1985, both through private member's bills. A supporter of Scottish devolution, he was involved in the drafting of ""A Claim of Right for Scotland"" in 1988.
After serving on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Foulkes was appointed to the Opposition frontbench in 1983, serving as a shadow Europe minister and later a shadow foreign and Commonwealth affairs minister. In 1992, he was made Shadow Minister for Defence, Disarmament and Arms Control.[1] He was forced to resign in 1993, after being convicted of being drunk and disorderly during an incident in which he struck a police officer.[5] He returned to the frontbench in 1994, serving as deputy to Overseas Aid spokespersons Joan Lestor and Clare Short until 1997.[6]When Labour won the general election in 1997, Foulkes was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the new Department for International Development. He was then Minister of State for Scotland from 2001 until a May 2002 cabinet reshuffle. He stepped down from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election.

House of Lords[edit]
Foulkes in 2006On 13 May 2005, it was announced that Foulkes was to receive a life peerage. On 16 June 2005, he was created Baron Foulkes of Cumnock, of Cumnock in East Ayrshire.[7] He was made a member of the Privy Council in July of that year.[1] He continued to be an ""ultra loyalist"" to the 1997–2010 Labour government.[8] He was a strong supporter of 2006 government proposals for mandatory identity cards.[9] He also continued to support the Iraq War and described Tony Blair's conduct of the war as clearly intentioned, carried through brilliantly and resulting in much improvement for the people of Iraq. Commenting on Sir Christopher Meyer's testimony to the Iraq Inquiry in 2009, he described the inquiry as ""a procession of primadonnas and the usual suspects grandstanding for the TV"".[10]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2017Foulkes was a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee in the Cabinet Office from 2007 to 2010 and the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy from 2010 to 2015. He serves on the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Board of Governors of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. Since March 2011, he has been a member of the Lords EU Select Committee and Lords EU Sub Committee on Social Policy and Consumer Protection.
Foulkes is very active on Caribbean matters, serving as president of the Caribbean Council, chair of the Belize and Dominican Republic All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs), and vice-chair of the Trinidad and Tobago and British–Central America APPGs. He is also a member of Labour Friends of Israel.[11]In April 2008, Foulkes was criticised for his expenses claims. Between April 2007 and March 2008, he claimed £54,527 in expenses from the House of Lords but, in January 2009, was shown to have one of the lowest expenses claims in the Scottish Parliament.[8][12][13] During the 2009 expenses controversy, he attacked media presenters in an exchange with the BBC's Carrie Gracie. He said some presenters, such as Jeremy Paxman and John Humphrys, were being paid to ""sneer at democracy and undermine democracy"".[14] However, in August 2009, Foulkes made a series of Freedom of Information requests about the expenses of retiring British Army head General Sir Richard Dannatt. He was accused by Shadow Defence Secretary Liam Fox of leading a New Labour smear campaign.[15]Foulkes was one of the fifty signatories to a letter published in The Guardian in 2010, which called for Pope Benedict XVI not to be given a state visit to the UK, and accused the Catholic Church of increasing the spread of Aids and promoting segregated education.[16] On 24 August 2011, The Scotsman reported that he had announced he would table an amendment to the Scotland Bill with the intention to make it impossible for the Scottish Government to sustain free university education for students in Scotland.[17] On 2 February 2012, he tabled a motion calling for the Scottish independence referendum to contain no extra question on increased devolution, and proposing a separate referendum be held on the subject in the event independence were rejected and Scotland voted to stay in the UK.[18]Foulkes in July 2019 was among 67 Labour peers to lend their names to an unauthorised advertisement in The Guardian which criticised Jeremy Corbyn for failing to effectively tackle antisemitism in the party.[19] In August, he said Richard Leonard and Lesley Laird should resign as Leader and Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party respectively, accusing Leonard of having ""no charisma and no leadership credentials"" and saying ""almost anyone would be better"" than Laird.[20] He repeated calls for Leonard to resign in July 2020.[21]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
Foulkes returned to electoral politics in 2007 when he was first on Scottish Labour's Lothians regional list in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. He appeared in place of leader Jack McConnell on a February 2007 Question Time special and accused Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond of acting in a ""xenophobic way"" for saying Gordon Brown was an example of ""London Labour"".[22] Former Scottish Labour leader Henry McLeish joined others calling on Foulkes to apologise for the claim.[23] He was elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament on 3 May 2007. After his election, he appeared on the BBC's Scotland at Ten radio program and criticised the SNP for ""trying to build up a situation in Scotland where the services are manifestly better than south of the border in a number of areas"" in an interview. When asked by presenter Colin Mackay ""Is that a bad thing?"", Foulkes responded, ""No, but they are doing it deliberately.""[24]In the Scottish Parliament, Foulkes was part of Labour's opposition to the minority SNP government, regularly tabling parliamentary questions criticising the Scottish Government's conduct. He highlighted several supposed irregularities, including the taxpayer-funded entertaining of wealthy SNP backers at Bute House and preferential treatment for Stagecoach in the Forth hovercraft project, after their co-founder Brian Souter donated £500,000 to the SNP.[25][26] Foulkes became a target of criticism by SNP bloggers, whom he branded ""Cybernats"".[27][28] He was also part of a campaign for presumed consent on organ donation.[29]Foulkes did not seek re-election in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, with the Lothian list instead returning Sarah Boyack, Neil Findlay and Kezia Dugdale. Dugdale had previously served as his constituency agent and would go on to become Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.[30][31]
Council of Europe[edit]
In June 2003, Tony Blair appointed Foulkes as a UK delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and Assembly of the Western European Union.[32]In January 2022, Foulkes and four other Labour delegates tabled ten amendments[33] to Resolution 2417, ""Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe"".[34] The amendments sought to include the word ""sex"" alongside gender identity, de-conflate the situation in the UK from Hungary, Poland, Russia and Turkey, and remove references to alleged anti-LGBTI movements in the UK. The delegates received both praise[35] and criticism.[36]
Personal life[edit]
Foulkes married his wife Elizabeth Anna Hope in 1970 and they have two sons and one daughter together.[37] He was chairman of Heart of Midlothian football club from April 2004 until his resignation in October 2005. He resigned in protest at the majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov dismissing Hearts chief executive Phil Anderton.[38] He later failed to be elected Rector of the University of Edinburgh on 12 February 2009, securing 31% of the vote to the 69% taken by Iain Macwhirter.[39]

Personal detailsBornGeorge Newlands Reid (1939-06-04) 4 June 1939 (age 84)Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySpouseDaphne MacCollChildren2Alma materUniversity of St Andrews Union CollegeSir George Newlands Reid KT FRSE[1] (born 4 June 1939) is a Scottish politician and journalist who served as Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2003 to 2007. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Mid Scotland and Fife region from 1999 to 2003 and then for the Ochil constituency from 2003 to 2007. Reid was Member of Parliament (MP) for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire from February 1974 to 1979.

Early life[edit]
Reid was born on 4 June 1939 in Tullibody, near Alloa, Clackmannanshire, the son of George Reid, a company director, and Margaret (née Forsyth).[1] He was educated at Tullibody School and Dollar Academy.[1] Reid attended the University of St Andrews, where he earned an MA with First-class honours in History in 1962. He then continued with further studies in Switzerland and at Union College in the United States, obtaining a diploma in international relations.[2]
Journalist career[edit]
Reid worked as a broadcast journalist and television producer for the BBC, Granada Television and Scottish Television, and as a print journalist for several newspapers. In this time he produced over 200 television documentaries, including Emmy winner Contract 736, about the construction of the RMS Queen Elizabeth 2.[2]After leaving Westminster he briefly returned to journalism. For BBC Scotland, he presented Agenda, which was produced by Kirsty Wark. He was producer of the famous reportage by Michael Buerk of the Ethiopian famine of 1984 that inspired the Band Aid and Live Aid charity campaigns, which led him to be headhunted by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent.[3][4] He was part of an international disaster team that responded to the 1988 Armenian earthquake.[5][6] He was Director of Public Affairs of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent for 12 years, based in Geneva, Switzerland, but working worldwide in conflict and disaster zones.[7]
Political career[edit]
Early political career[edit]
Reid was elected as the Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire in the February 1974 general election, with a majority of 3,610.[8] He more than doubled his majority to 7,341 in the October 1974 general election,[9] but then lost by a narrow 984 votes in the 1979 general election.[10]During his time at Westminster he served as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and that of the Western European Union.[11]In 1995 Reid re-entered Scottish politics by delivering the annual Donaldson Lecture at the SNP conference, drawing on his knowledge of continental European politics to argue a case for why a party like the SNP could be expected to prosper if a Scottish Parliament was established. Labour Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland George Robertson's contrary claim that devolution would ""kill the SNP stone dead"" was dismissed by Reid by saying ""Ho, ho, ho"".[12]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
He stood in the Ochil constituency, which covered approximately the same area as his old seat, at Westminster in the UK general election 1997, coming in second.[13] When the new Labour administration moved forward with proposals for a Scottish Parliament, Reid first served on the pre-establishment Consultative Steering Group,[14] and then was elected in the first election in 1999 to represent Mid Scotland and Fife.
At the opening of the Parliament Reid was defeated 82 votes to 44 by Sir David Steel for the position of Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and was instead elected a Deputy Presiding Officer.[15]
Reid with Elizabeth II at the opening of the 2nd Scottish Parliament, 2003Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament (2003–2007)[edit]
At the 2003 Scottish Parliament election Reid succeeded in winning the Ochil constituency first past the post.[16] He was then elected by his fellow MSPs to succeed David Steel as Presiding Officer.[17][18] As the Presiding Officer is expected to be strictly nonpartisan, he voluntarily suspended his SNP membership for the duration of his tenure.
As the Presiding Officer has a role in advising the monarch, Reid was appointed a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2004.[19] He oversaw the completion of the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood and the move from the Mound to Holyrood in 2004.[20] At the official opening of the new building that year, he made a keynote speech in which he paid tribute to the construction as an architectural achievement, and urged parliamentarians to ""listen to the building"" to inspire them in their future endeavours.[21]As Presiding Officer he also led the creation of a Scottish Futures Forum, to promote cross-party strategic thinking.[22][23] He was appointed President of the Royal Commonwealth Society Scotland,[24] and became Patron of the Scottish Disability Equality Forum.[25]
Post–Presiding Officer[edit]
Reid chose not to seek re-election at the end of the 2007 Parliamentary term. As an independent figure with experience of a devolved parliament, he was chosen to lead a review of the administration of the troubled Northern Ireland Assembly.[26] Reid also joined the European Union's Caucasus-Caspian diplomatic commission.[27] On 19 April 2007 he was made a Freeman of the County of Clackmannanshire.[28] He had his portrait taken by photographer Harry Benson the same year.[29]In May 2008, Reid was appointed as the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for the duration of the General Assembly's sitting that year. He was then appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in January 2008, to serve as the Queen's personal representative to the Church of Scotland.[30] This position is second only to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in the ceremonial Order of Precedence.[31]In 2006 he was appointed by the University of Glasgow as an Honorary Professor in the School of Law.[2] Between 2008 and 2011 he was an independent adviser on the Scottish Ministerial Code.[32]In September 2009, Reid was appointed by the National Trust for Scotland to lead a wide-ranging internal governance review.[33] Reid produced a report, making a range of recommendations that were accepted by the Trust.[34] In 2009, he was appointed as Her Majesty's Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire.
He was an Electoral Commissioner from 2010 to 2014.[35][36]In 2013 he underwent major surgery for bladder cancer.[32] He resigned all his positions, then made a good recovery.[37]
Awards and honours[edit]
After relief efforts for the 1988 Armenian earthquake Reid was recognised with the Gold Medal of the Supreme Soviet of Armenia and the Pirogov Gold Medal of the USSR.[11]During his time as Presiding Officer he won the Herald newspaper's Scottish Politician of the Year award in 2003 and 2005, becoming the first person to have won the award on two occasions,[38][39] followed by a lifetime achievement award in 2013.[32] Reid was made a Free man of Clackmannanshire in 2007.[40]He received also several honorary doctorates, i.e. an LLD degree from the University of St Andrews in 2005,[41][42] a DUniv degree from Queen Margaret University in 2006,[43] the degree of Dr.h.c. from the University of Edinburgh in 2007,[44] and a DUniv degree from the University of Stirling in 2008.[45]Reid was knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to Scottish politics and public life.[46][47] In 2015, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE).[48]On 10 June 2022, Reid was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Thistle (KT).[49]

Personal detailsBorn (1942-11-11) 11 November 1942 (age 81)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyGilbert Martin Paterson (born in Springburn, Glasgow, 1942) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician, who served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Clydebank and Milngavie, from 2011 to 2021. Previously he had been an MSP for the West of Scotland region, having been elected on 3 May 2007. From 1999 to 2003 he was an MSP for Central Scotland.

Career[edit]
Brought up in Springburn in the North of Glasgow,[1] Paterson attended Possilpark Secondary School, before building up his own business Gil's Motor Factors.[2] He served as a Scottish National Party (SNP) councillor in Strathclyde Regional Council and sat on the SNP's National Executive Committee, before being elected as one of five SNP MSPs for Central Scotland in the first election to the Scottish Parliament. During the first parliamentary term he sat on both the Local Government and Procedures committees in the Parliament.
At the 2003 election, only three SNP MSPs were returned for Central Scotland and Paterson lost his seat in Parliament. He returned to running his business but stayed active in the SNP, becoming the party's vice-convenor in charge of fundraising, a position he had held previously.
Paterson was one of the heaviest critics of the leadership style of John Swinney, and in the aftermath of the 2004 European election he openly called for Swinney's resignation, which happened shortly afterwards.[3][4]In 2006, Paterson was selected to stand as candidate for the Clydebank and Milngavie Scottish Parliamentary constituency.
In the 2016-2021 session of the Scottish Parliament, Paterson was elected as the SNP Group convener.[5] He is also a member of two committees, 'European and External Relations' and 'Subordinate Legislation', the latter of which he is deputy-convener.
In August 2020,[6] Paterson announced that he would be stepping down as an MSP at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[7][8] Writing in the Clydebank Post, he said, ""I shall not be seeking re-election in May due to personal circumstances. This was a decision I took very reluctantly, after a long period of reflection.""[6]
Ideological positions[edit]
Paterson gave interviews to reporters about the result in the West Dunbartonshire constituency in the 2017 general election.Brexit[edit]
Paterson voted Remain in the June 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's EU membership. He was active in raising Brexit concerns for business and economics in Scotland, including questioning First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament.[9]
Free tuition[edit]
Mr Paterson is a supporter of free tuition fees in Scotland, and appeared in the Milngavie and Bearsden Herald in August 2017 asking for clarity from East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, a Liberal Democrat, about her stance following comments made by her party leader, Vince Cable, in The Press and Journal.[10]

Personal detailsPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materUniversity of GlasgowWebsitegillianmartinmsp.comGillian Anne Martin is a Scottish politician who is serving as Minister for Energy since 2023. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP). she has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Aberdeenshire East since 2016.[1]
Early life and career[edit]
Martin grew up in Newburgh[2] and was educated at Ellon Academy.[3] Her parents have always been politically active.[4]A graduate of the University of Glasgow, she worked as a lecturer in further education for 15 years, including at North East Scotland College. [5] Alongside this, Martin ran her own business in video production and training for the energy sector.
She was the manager of an emergency media response team for oil and gas companies for 10 years.[6]
Early political activity[edit]
Martin became politically active during the Scottish independence referendum.[7] She helped found Women for Independence (WFI).[8] She was on the WFI executive committee as the member for North East region, and has continued participation as an ordinary member since becoming an MSP.[3]She joined the SNP on 19 September 2014, on the morning after the Scottish independence referendum.[5] She emerged as a candidate for the Aberdeenshire East constituency of the Scottish Parliament in July 2015.[3] and was selected by local party members the following month.[9]
Political career[edit]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
Martin was elected to serve as a MSP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[10] The seat was previously held by Alex Salmond.
Martin brought forward the Seat Belts on School Transport (Scotland) Bill.[11] The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a requirement to Scottish law that all dedicated home-to-school transport service vehicles are fitted with seat belts, as there is presently no UK legal obligation for the provision of seatbelts on such vehicles.

Failed appointment as a Junior Minister[edit]
On 27 June 2018 the Scottish Government announced that Martin would be appointed Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science.[12] However, following media attention around a series of offensive blogs Martin wrote during her time as a college lecturer, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon subsequently withdrew Martin's nomination when presenting her new ministerial team to the Scottish Parliament for approval.[13][14] Among the controversial blog entries, Martin mocked trans women as ""hairy knuckled lipstick- wearing transitional transgender Laydees"".[15] She also wrote of a survey of transgender people, ""the EU clearly have a Tranny Trove [of money]"".[16] Of Scotland's membership of the United Kingdom she wrote, ""Don’t make me trot out the now clichéd comparison to the abused partner in a marriage. Cliché it may be but clichés come from truth.""[17] And of African American customers she wrote they were to be, ""To be avoided.""[18]
Backbencher; 2018 to 2023[edit]
In September 2018, Martin was appointed as Convener of the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee.
From 2016 to 2018 Martin was co-convenor of the Scottish Parliament cross-party group on Oil and Gas.[19] She has used her time in parliament to highlight the downturn of the oil and gas sector in the North East, and the effect it has had on those living in Aberdeenshire East. Martin has spoken out on behalf of workers who have been discriminated against due to their oil and gas connections,[20] and has been a vocal supporter of the efforts being by the Scottish Government made to assist those facing unemployment.[21]
Minister for Energy and the Environment; 2023 to present[edit]
On the 29th of March 2023, Martin was appointed Minister for Energy.[22] Her role was expanded to include the environment.[23][24]
Personal life[edit]
Martin is married to a teacher named John Martin who teaches at Turriff Academy and has two children. She lives in Newmachar, Aberdeenshire.

Controversies[edit]
In 2018, Martin apologised ""unreservedly"" for ""inappropriate and offensive"" remarks she had posted on a blog about transgender people in 2007.[25] On 28 June 2018, she issued a second apology about offensive remarks made a decade earlier about the tipping habits of black customers.[26]

vteBorn and raised into a Labour supporting coal mining family in Fife, McLeish dropped out of Buckhaven High School at the age of fifteen to pursue a professional career in football. Playing wing half, he was first signed for Leeds United F.C., but after experiencing homesickness, McLeish returned to his native of Fife to play for East Fife F.C.. Making more than 108 appearances, he was one of the youngest ever players to play in Scottish professional football. McLeish's career was cut short after an injury and he returned to education, studying at Heriot-Watt University. 
McLeish joined the Labour Party in 1970 and was later elected to the Fife Regional Council, where he served as the council's leader from 1982 to 1987. After several unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the British House of Commons, McLeish was successful in the 1987 general election, when he was elected as member of parliament for Central Fife. He served successively in Labour's opposition benches for ten years, before being appointed minister of state for Scotland under Prime Minister Tony Blair following the party's landslide victory in the 1997 election. McLeish served as Donald Dewar's 'right-hand man' in the Scottish Office and was instrumental in assisting Dewar with the creation of the Scotland Act, which established of the Scottish Parliament after nearly 300 years. In the first election to the reconvened parliament in 1999, he was elected as a member of the Scottish Parliament for the Central Fife constituency. Following the appointment as Dewar as the inaugural first minister of Scotland, he served in the first Scottish Executive as the minister for enterprise and lifelong learning from 1999 to 2000.
Dewar died in office of a brain haemorrhage on 11 October 2000, which triggered a leadership contest within the Labour Party to find a successor, with McLeish declaring his candidacy. He led a successful and short campaign after defeating finance minister Jack McConnell. McLeish was sworn into office as first minister of Scotland on 26 October 2000. He oversaw the implementation of the McCrone Agreement for teachers in Scotland and strongly advocated free personal care for the elderly scheme. His tenure as first minister was short, as he resigned the following year following a financial scandal referred to as ""Officegate""; the first major scandal the Scottish Parliament had faced since its reincarnation two years earlier. He was succeeded by McConnell, who he had beaten in the previous leadership election. McLeish sat as a backbencher, before stepping down as an MSP at the 2003 election.
Since leaving office, McLeish has remained politically active and has written several books. In 2007, he was appointed to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission and the following year he chaired the Scottish Prisons Commission.[1] In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, he campaigned in favour of remaining in the UK. However, following the Brexit referendum, McLeish stated he would back another Scottish independence referendum if Scotland was taken out of the EU against its wishes.

Early life and education[edit]
Henry Baird McLeish[2] was born at 50 Morar Street in Methil, Fife,[3] on 15 June 1948, to Harry McLeish (1923-2009) and Mary Slaven Baird (1925-1985).[4][5][6] Born into a ""strong Christian socialist influence"" household in central Fife, where his father and grandfather worked as coal miners for a private company, McLeish's grandmother was a member of the Labour and Co-operative Party for seventy years.[7][8] He was named after his maternal grandfather.[9] McLeish grew up on Morar Street, before moving to Institution Row, a miner community, when he was two or three. The family moved to a new housing estate for mineworkers in the old village of Kennoway, where his younger brother Ronald was born.[10]McLeish was educated at the Buckhaven High School,[11] where he became involved with the school's football team.[12] He met his childhood sweetheart while attending the school, Margaret Drysdale, and they married in 1968.[13] While a pupil at the school, he was ""too concerned with football"", having been told by his headmaster he had no future in education.[14]McLeish returned to education following his injury, studying at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh from 1968 to 1973. He graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Town Planning.[15] After graduating, McLeish worked as a research officer at Edinburgh Corporation's department of social work from 1973 to 1974, then as a planning officer for Fife County Council from 1974 to 1975 and Dunfermline District Council from 1975 to 1987. He also worked as a part-time lecturer and tutor at Heriot-Watt University from 1973 to 1986.[16]
Professional football career[edit]
In 1963, McLeish left school at the age of 15 to become a professional football player.[14] His rector wrote on his school report card: ""I am glad the boy is a good footballer as he has no future in education.""[17] He was first signed with Leeds United, however, after experiencing homesickness, he returned to Scotland to play for East Fife, where he made 108 appearances.[18][19] He played wing-half and was one of the youngest ever players to play in Scottish professional football. His first game for East Fife was at Hampden Park against the Glasgow team, Queen’s Park.[20][21]At the age of 18, McLeish trialled for a Scotland youth national team, playing against a group of footballers from Motherwell, but they lost 5–2.[22]The Daily Record reported on the match and stated McLeish was the only young Scot to impress.[23] He was later selected for the Scotland team to play in the World Youth Cup, hosted by Yugoslavia.[23] McLeish also played for junior football clubs; St Andrews United and Glenrothes Juniors.[23] His footballing career was cut short by a leg injury, and he returned to education.[24]
Early political career[edit]
Entry into local government; 1970-1987[edit]
McLeish joined the Scottish Labour Party in 1970 and he became chairman of the Young Socialists.[25] He first contested in an election for the Glenwood ward in Glenrothes but he was beaten by the sitting Scottish Conservative councillor.[25] He began his political career on the Kirkcaldy District Council from 1974 to 1977, serving as the council's planning committee chairman. He later served on the Fife Regional Council 1978 to 1987 and served as the as leader of Fife Regional Council from 1982. As the council leader, he implemented a ""municipal socialist"" manifesto, proposing free bus passes and TV licences for pensioners.[15]At the 1979 UK general election, he ran for the East Fife constituency for the British House of Commons. McLeish was unsuccessful, having been placed third, behind the Conservatives' Barry Henderson and the Liberals' Menzies Campbell. In 1981, he began to challenge Willie Hamilton in the Central Fife constituency. Hamilton was a right-wing Labour MP known nationally for his anti-monarchy views. He gave up his attempts to retain his candidacy, allowing McLeish to run in the 1987 election.[15]
Labour in opposition; 1987-1997[edit]
The Labour Party failed to defeat Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party in the 1987 election and McLeish served in several shadow spokesman portfolios, including education and employment from 1988 to 1989 and employment and training from 1989 to 1992. Despite the end of Thatcher's eleven year tenure, Labour failed again to defeat the incumbent Conservatives, returning to opposition. McLeish served as shadow minister for the Scottish Office from 1992 to 1994.[15]In 1994, following Tony Blair's election as Leader of the Labour Party, McLeish served successively as the shadow minister for transport from 1994 to 1995, shadow minister for health from 1995 to 1996, and shadow minister for social security from 1996 to 1997.[15]
1997 Scottish devolution referendum[edit]
At the 1997 UK general election, McLeish served as Labour's election campaign director for Scotland. In the election, Labour defeated the Conservatives in a landslide victory. He was appointed by Blair as the Minister of State for Scotland, with responsibility for home affairs and devolution. McLeish worked alongside Donald Dewar on the Scotland Act 1998, which established the Scottish Parliament.[15]As Dewar's right-hand man in Westminster, McLeish helped secure devolution for Scotland and manoeuvre the Scotland Act through the Westminster Parliament.[15]
Dewar administration; 1999-2000[edit]
McLeish, third from the right, seated at the first meeting of the Dewar government, 1999After the creation of the Scottish Parliament in May 1999, McLeish was elected as MSP for Fife Central and became Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.[15]2000 Labour leadership bid[edit]
Main article: 2000 Scottish Labour leadership election
On 11 October 2000, Dewar died of a brain haemorrhage following a fall outside Bute House the following day. Deputy First Minister Jim Wallace served as the acting First Minister, until the election of a new leader of Scottish Labour was held after Dewar's funeral. On 19 October, McLeish launched his bid to be the next leader of the Scottish Labour Party, with Jack McConnell later announcing his bid.[26]The ballot was held amongst a restricted electorate of Labour MSPs and members of Scottish Labour's national executive, because there was insufficient time for a full election to be held. McLeish defeated his rival Jack McConnell by 44 votes to 36 in the race to become the second first minister.[27]
First Minister of Scotland (2000-2001)[edit]
Main article: Premiership of Henry McLeish
Queen Elizabeth II gives McLeish royal warrant of appointment ahead of his swearing-in as first minister of Scotland the Court of Session.McLeish was officially sworn into office as first minister of Scotland on 27 October 2000 at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after receiving the Royal Warrant of Appointment by Queen Elizabeth II.[28][29] The following day, he formed his administration, which was a continuation of the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition.[30]
September 11 attacks[edit]
McLeish with President of the United States George W. Bush in the Oval Office, April 2001McLeish was First Minister during the time of the September 11 attacks in the United States, and watched the events unfold in his office in St Andrews House, the HQ of the Scottish Government in Edinburgh.[31] McLeish has spoken about his serious concern about the defence strategies in place within Scotland to protect the country from a terrorist attack of a similar nature. He initially worried about Scotland's major cities, such as Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen being targets based on their economic strength and significance to the Scottish, UK and European economies.[31] In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, McLeish focussed on strengthening security, protection and defence systems in Scotland to ensure the country was equipped to deal with a large scale terrorist attack. McLeish lead the then Scottish Executive to working with the UK Government to ensure appropriate measures and strengthen security was in place within Scotland.[31]In the immediate aftermath of the attacks in the United States, McLeish instructed all airports in Scotland to be on alert and tighten their security measures.[32]On September 13, 2001, McLeish moved a motion in the Scottish Parliament to send condolences to the people of the United States and New York.[32] Through the motion, McLeish said ""the Parliament condemns the senseless and abhorrent acts of terrorism carried out in the United States yesterday and extends our deepest sympathies to those whose loved ones have been killed or injured"".[33]As a Labour First Minister, and with a Labour UK Government in office at the time of the attacks under Tony Blair, McLeish initially supported the War on Terror, however stated in 2021 that he regrets that the war ultimately turned out as a ""war on Islam"".[31]
Governmental record[edit]
Neil Kinnock (left), Helen Liddel (centre) and McLeish (right), 2000Professor John Curtice, a prominent political analyst, commented that McLeish would not have the ""kind of authority"" that Donald Dewar enjoyed.[27] He travelled widely, particularly in the United States. He managed several task forces designed to improve the competitiveness of Scottish industry, especially the PILOT project for Scottish oil and gas supply chains.
He was embarrassed when an open microphone recorded him with Helen Liddell in a television studio, describing Scottish Secretary John Reid as ""a patronising bastard"" and said of his colleague, Brian Wilson, ""Brian is supposed to be in charge of Africa but he spends most of his time in bloody Dublin. He is a liability"".[34]
Acts of Parliament[edit]
Whilst in government serving as first minister, McLeish oversaw and implemented the free personal care for the elderly scheme[35] as well as the implementation of the McCrone Agreement for education teachers in Scotland.[36]
Officegate and resignation[edit]
Main article: Officegate
McLeish resigned as first minister in November 2001, amid a scandal involving allegations he sub-let part of his tax-subsidised Westminster constituency office without it having been registered in the register of interests kept in the Parliamentary office.[citation needed]The press called the affair Officegate. Though McLeish could not have personally benefited financially from the oversight, he undertook to repay the £36,000 rental income, and resigned to allow Scottish Labour a clean break to prepare for the 2003 Scottish Parliament election.[37] McLeish did not seek re-election.

Post-premiership[edit]
McLeish at a charity football match in 2011Since leaving mainstream politics, McLeish has lectured widely in the United States, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the University of Arkansas, where he holds a visiting professorship shared between the Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences and the University of Arkansas School of Law. He is considered an expert on European-American relations and on the European Union.
In August 2007, he was appointed to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission, established by the Scottish Government. He also chaired the Scottish Prisons Commission, which produced a report into sentencing and the criminal justice system in 2008 entitled ""Scotland's Choice"".[38] McLeish concluded a ""major report"" on the state of football in Scotland, which had been commissioned by the Scottish Football Association, in April 2010.[1]McLeish claimed that Scottish football was ""underachieving, under performing and under funded"" at a press conference to unveil the report.[1]
Political views[edit]
Scottish devolution[edit]
As a strong devolutionist, he was one of the original signatories of the claim of right at the inaugural meeting of the 1989 Scottish constitutional convention which paved the way for devolution.

Scottish nationalism[edit]
In the run up to the referendum on Scottish independence on 18 September 2014, there was much media and public speculation towards whether McLeish backed a ""No"" vote to remain within the United Kingdom, or whether he supported a ""Yes"" vote in order to create an independent separate sovereign Scotland.
Speculation from the public came from media articles in which McLeish was reported to be talking negatively about the prospect of a ""No"" vote to remain within the union, but was later reported as stating it would be ""near impossible"" to vote Yes in the referendum.[39]Following the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership, in which the majority of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, but the majority of the Scottish electorate voted to remain in the EU, McLeish has since claimed that he would support and campaign for an independent Scottish sovereign state and campaign for it to be a fully functioning member and participate fully within the European Union despite Brexit.[40] In September 2021, he reiterated that he would support independence if the union was not reformed.[41]

O'Donnell was elected in 2007 as a Liberal Democrat Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Central Scotland region. He was previously an aide to the former MSP Donald Gorrie.
He resigned from the party on 27 March 2011 unhappy with the direction of his party and the UK Coalition Government in Westminster.[1]  He sat as an independent MSP until the May 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when he stood as an independent candidate and was not re-elected, having won only 821 votes.[2]
Background[edit]
O'Donnell was educated at Falkirk College of Further Education and Queen Margaret College (in partnership with Southern Connecticut State University) and has an HND and a BA (Hons) in Communications.
Prior to his election he worked in retail, property, as a college lecturer, a constituency assistant to Donald Gorrie MSP, and as a community care professional.
He contested the Scottish Parliament election in 1999 for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, coming a distant third. He was one of only eight Scots chosen by the United Nations to supervise the first ever free elections in the former Yugoslavian province of Kosovo in 2001.[citation needed]
Party positions[edit]
O'Donnell was a member of both the Scottish and Federal policy committees and held the position of Vice Convenor and Treasurer of the Central Scotland Liberal Democrats.
He was once the Scottish Liberal Democrat Deputy Spokesperson on Education and Young People.

Interests[edit]
O'Donnell had a particular interest in disability rights issues, minority groups' rights and social issues. Outside politics, Hugh's interests are reading, historical research, DIY and tai chi.
O'Donnell is a widower with no partner and has two grown-up children: a son and a daughter.[3]
Departure from the party[edit]
On 26 March 2011, O'Donnell announced his decision to leave the Liberal Democrats. He had been the leading candidate in the party's Central Scotland list for the 2011 Holyrood election campaign, but decided to stand as an independent candidate in the region.
O'Donnell criticised the fact that there has not been enough opposition from the Scottish party towards the coalition government policy.[1] He was critical of the party's then Scottish leader Tavish Scott and said founding principles have been ""subsumed"" by a desire for position and power. The leadership could no longer be regarded as ""either Liberal or Democratic"", he said, adding: ""The greatest betrayal of all, of course, is the alliance formed in London between the Lib Dems and the Tories."" He said: ""Since that fateful day, I have watched helplessly from the sidelines as this Government at Westminster has attacked every vulnerable group in Scotland, from carers to disabled students to migrants, with some of the most draconian policies I have ever seen in the name of cuts.
O'Donnell said he and his erstwhile MSP colleagues had been told not to air grievances about the Westminster coalition. He said: ""Not a word of criticism from the party leadership in Scotland has been uttered - even though the contempt shown for Scotland and, indeed, the federal structure of the party knows no bounds.""
O'Donnell expressed his unhappiness with the decision to hold a referendum on whether the Alternative Vote should replace traditional first-past-the-post for Westminster elections on the same day as the Scottish parliamentary election. He also complained that the Scottish Lib Dem group had voted tactically against the SNP's proposed policy on minimum pricing on alcohol, rather than on principle. In 2010, the policy failed to win enough support in parliament to progress, despite support from medical, health, police and victim support groups. He wrote: ""I have fought the leadership as hard as I could, but I am just too tired to do it any more... This is not the same party I joined, full of enthusiasm, all those years ago... I can no longer be party to the control freakery, the 'image is everything' attitude, and the dictatorial style of doing things... It is a party I no longer want to be part of and neither should other principled Liberals.""[4]The Scotland on Sunday[5] reported senior party figures were furious that O'Donnell did not speak to leader Tavish Scott before deciding to quit. A senior Liberal Democrat source said: ""He didn't even pick up the phone to the party leader. Apparently he's been unhappy for some time. He is not going to be missed and we will be a far more united team without him.""

He served under his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon as justice secretary from 2018 to 2021 and then as health secretary from 2021 to 2023. He has been Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Pollok since 2016, having previously been a regional MSP for Glasgow from 2011 to 2016.
Born to Pakistani immigrants in Glasgow, Yousaf studied politics at the University of Glasgow, before working as a parliamentary assistant for Bashir Ahmad, the first Muslim and second generation immigrant elected to the Scottish Parliament. Following Ahmad’s death in 2009, Yousaf went on to work as a parliamentary assistant for both Alex Salmond and Sturgeon. Prior to his election to parliament in 2011, he worked in the SNP's party headquarters as a communications officer. Appointed as a junior minister under Salmond in 2012, Yousaf served as Minister for External Affairs and International Development until 2014.
Yousaf supported Sturgeon's successful leadership bid in 2014 and after she was sworn in as first minister, he was subsequently appointed as Europe minister before being appointed Minister for Transport and the Islands in 2016. As part of a cabinet reshuffle of Sturgeon's second ministry in 2018, Yousaf was promoted to the cabinet as justice secretary. He introduced a controversial bill to parliament which ultimately became law as the Hate Crime and Public Order Act 2021.[2][3] In 2021, he was appointed health secretary during the later phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and was responsible for the NHS's recovery, as well as the mass roll-out of the vaccination programme which began under his predecessor. Following Sturgeon's resignation as leader of the SNP and as first minister, Yousaf won the 2023 SNP leadership election, defeating Kate Forbes with 52% to her 48% in the final stage.
Yousaf was appointed first minister on 29 March 2023, becoming the youngest person, the first Scottish Asian, and the first Muslim to serve in office. He was sworn into the Privy Council in May 2023.[4]
Early life and education[edit]
Humza Haroon Yousaf was born in Rutherglen Maternity Hospital in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire on 7 April 1985.[5][6][7] He is the son of first-generation Pakistani-Punjabi Arain immigrants: his father Mian Muzaffar Yousaf Arain was born in Mian Channu, Punjab, Pakistan, and emigrated from the city with his family in the 1960s, eventually working as an accountant.[8][9]
His paternal grandfather worked in the Singer sewing machine factory in Clydebank in the 1960s.[10] Yousaf's mother, Shaaista Bhutta, was born in Nairobi, Kenya, to a family of Pakistani-Punjabi descent.[11][10] Due to their non-African background, her family was regularly harassed and occasionally assaulted: following an incident where her mother was attacked with an axe, they emigrated to Scotland.[12]Humza attended Mearns Primary School in East Renfrewshire.[13][14][15] Yousaf was one of two ethnic-minority pupils to attend his primary school.[12] Yousaf was privately educated at Hutchesons' Grammar School, an independent school in Glasgow, where his Modern Studies lessons inspired him to become involved in politics.[16][17]He described the September 11 attacks as the ""day that changed the world and for me"" when he was 16 years old. Prior to the attack, Yousaf was close to two pupils whom he sat next to in his registration class, but after the attack in New York, he claims that they asked him questions such as, ""Why do Muslims hate America?""[12]Yousaf studied politics at the University of Glasgow where he was President of the Glasgow University Muslim Students Association.[12][18] He graduated in 2007 with a Master of Arts (MA).[19]

Early career and political involvement[edit]
From an early age, Yousaf was involved in community work, ranging from youth organisations to charity fundraising.[20] He was the volunteer media spokesperson for the charity Islamic Relief,[20] worked for community radio for twelve years and on a project which provided food packages to homeless people and asylum seekers in Glasgow.[21]Yousaf joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 2005, while studying at Glasgow university. Speeches by then-party leader Alex Salmond and anti-war activist Rose Gentle speaking out against the Iraq War convinced him that independence would be the only way for Scotland to avoid going to war.[22] He started campaigning extensively for the SNP, including for the 2007 Scottish parliament election, which resulted in the first SNP government in Scotland and Yousaf's first job in the Scottish parliament.[12]In 2006, Yousaf worked in an O2 call centre,[23] before working as a parliamentary assistant for Bashir Ahmad, from Ahmad's election as Scotland's first Muslim MSP in 2007 until Ahmad's death two years later.[24] Ahmad was a personal influence. Yousaf then worked as parliamentary assistant for a few other MSPs including Anne McLaughlin, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond, who was then First Minister.[25][26] Before his election to the Scottish Parliament, he worked in the SNP's headquarters as a communications officer.[23]In 2008, whilst working as an aide, Yousaf partook of the International Visitor Leadership Program, a professional exchange run by the United States Department of State.[27] He was awarded the “Future Force of Politics” at the Young Scottish Minority Ethnic Awards in 2009, which was presented to him in Glasgow City Chambers.[28]
Early parliamentary career[edit]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011Yousaf was elected to the Scottish Parliament as an additional member for the Glasgow electoral region in the 2011 election.[29][30] At 26 years old, he was the youngest MSP to be elected to the 4th parliament.[31] When being sworn in, he took his oath in English and then in Urdu, reflecting his Scottish-Pakistani identity;[32] he was dressed in a traditional sherwani decorated with a Partick Thistle tartan touch, and a plaid draped over his shoulder.[33]He served on the SNP's backbenches and was a member of the parliament's justice and public audit committees.[34] On 25 May 2011, Yousaf was appointed as a Parliamentary Liaison Officer to the Office of the First Minister, remaining in this post until 4 September 2012.[35]
Junior ministerial career (2012–2018)[edit]
On 5 September 2012, First Minister Alex Salmond appointed Yousaf as Minister for External Affairs and International Development, responsible for external affairs, international development; fair trade policy and diaspora.[36] This junior ministerial appointment saw him working under the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs. He was the first Scottish Asian and Muslim to be appointed as a minister to the Scottish Government.[37][38]
Yousaf signs Nicola Sturgeon's nomination for first minister, 19 November 2014In October 2013, he outlined the SNP's plans to set out the United Nations target for overseas aid at 0.7% in an independent Scotland and accused the UK Government of going back on its promise in the 2010 coalition agreement to guarantee that level of spending.[39] Yousaf also outlined that an independent Scotland would ""add a progressive voice to global issues promoting peace, equality and fairness"" and added independence would be ""achieved through a democratic, peaceful means without a single drop of blood being spilled and engaging with all the diverse communities that make up our rich tapestry in Scotland."".[40]When Nicola Sturgeon became First Minister in November 2014 following Salmond's resignation, she kept Yousaf as a junior minister, although the name of the position he held was changed to the Minister for Europe and International Development.[41]On 18 May 2016, he was appointed as Minister for Transport and the Islands following the formation of Sturgeon's second government.[42]
Cabinet Secretary for Justice (2018–2021)[edit]
On 26 June 2018, Sturgeon reshuffled her cabinet. She promoted Yousaf to the Scottish Cabinet to serve as Cabinet Secretary for Justice, succeeding Michael Matheson.[43] In the year prior to his appointment (2017–18), 244,504 crimes were recorded by the police in Scotland; in the final year of his tenure (2020–21), the figure was 246,511.[44]
Hate Crime Bill[edit]
One of his flagship policies was the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Bill, which he promised would streamline existing legislation as well as add additional protections to minorities while maintaining rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.[45] The bill has been criticised by the Catholic Church, the National Secular Society as well as writers,[46] and in September 2020 it was amended to remove prosecution for cases of unintentionally stirring up hate, which could theoretically include libraries stocking contentious books.[47] Despite his initial promises, Yousaf in October 2020 said that the exception to the Public Order Act 1986 which allows people to use ""otherwise illegal language"" in their own homes should be abolished.[48]
Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care (2021–2023)[edit]
Yousaf at the COP26 Climate Action for Health event, 2021In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Yousaf was re-elected as the MSP for the Glasgow Pollok constituency. The SNP fell two seats short of an overall majority in the election, but remained the largest party, with more than double the seats of the Scottish Conservatives. Sturgeon formed a third administration and appointed Yousaf as the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, succeeding Jeane Freeman, who stepped down at the election.[49]
COVID-19 pandemic[edit]
Further information: COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland
Yousaf at Scottish Government press conference on COVID-19 in 2020.Yousaf entered office amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2021 he said that ten children up to the age of nine had been admitted to Scottish hospitals in the previous week ""because of COVID"".[50] Professor Steve Turner, Scotland officer for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, contradicted him and said that children’s wards were “not seeing a rise in cases with Covid”. He added that the children in question had been hospitalised for other reasons. Yousaf clarified his statement and apologised for ""any undue alarm"".[51]In July, the World Health Organisation concluded that six out of Europe's ten virus hotspots were in Scotland.[52] Tayside topped the list with 1,002 cases per 100,000 head of population over the previous fortnight.[53] The Scottish Government was accused of being ‘missing in action’ after it emerged that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Yousaf were all on holiday.[54] Yousaf said he had promised to take his stepdaughter to Harry Potter World, tweeting that: ""Most important job I have is being a good father, step-father & husband to my wife and kids. In the last seven months they’ve had virtually no time from me.""[55]
NHS waiting times[edit]
In September 2021, the average waiting time for an ambulance in Scotland soared to six hours and Yousaf urged the public to ""think twice"" before they called 999. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane criticised the remark as “reckless messaging [that] could put lives at risk” and instead urged people to call an ambulance if they thought they needed one.[56] Following reports of elderly Scots dying whilst waiting for an ambulance to arrive,[57] Yousaf asked the Ministry of Defence for help and soldiers from the British Army were deployed to drive ambulances.[58] Audit Scotland concluded that 500 people died in Scotland in 2021 due to delayed access to emergency treatment.[59]
2023 SNP leadership election[edit]
Leadership campaign logoOn 15 February 2023, Nicola Sturgeon resigned as Leader of the Scottish National Party and First Minister of Scotland, which triggered a leadership election within the SNP to elect her successor.[60][61][62] On 18 February, Yousaf declared his candidacy for leader in an interview with the Sunday Mail.[63][64] He committed to challenging the UK Government over its decision to block the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill and stated he wanted to increase support for Scottish independence before delivering a referendum.[65][66]Yousaf launched his leadership campaign in Clydebank on 20 February.[67] He said he was not ""wedded"" with using the next UK general election as a de facto referendum on Scottish independence and that one of the issues would be the inability for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds to vote.[68][69] Yousaf reaffirmed his commitment to defend the Scottish Parliament against the UK Government's Section 35 order, which aims to block the gender reform bill.[70] He added that he could not pretend the bill had not ""caused some division"" within his party and stated he was ""keen to work with those who have got real concerns"".[70]During the campaign, Yousaf faced questions on why he missed the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014. He said at the time that he was meeting the Pakistani consul to discuss the case of a Scotsman facing the death penalty for blasphemy.[71] Yousaf stated his support for the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill, while his opponents Kate Forbes and Ash Regan opposed it.[72]As confirmed on 27 March 2023, Yousaf had won the leadership race, after being victorious in both rounds of voting. He won the first round with 48.2% of first-preference votes, ahead of Forbes who received 40.7%, and Regan who received 11.1%, thus eliminating Regan due to finishing last. He then also won the final round of voting with 52.1% of the vote compared to Forbes in second place with 47.9%.[73] Yousaf accepted the leadership at an event at Murrayfield Stadium where he promised to lead the party in the interest of all its members.[74]
First Minister of Scotland (2023–present)[edit]
Main article: Premiership of Humza Yousaf
Yousaf is formally sworn in as First Minister, at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, March 2023Yousaf was sworn in as first minister of Scotland on 29 March 2023,[75] becoming the youngest person and the first Scottish Asian and Muslim to hold the office since it was created in 1999.[76][77] In September 2023, the New Statesman named him the thirteenth most powerful left-wing figure in the UK.[78] In October 2023, The New York Times called him a ""trailblazer shaping our time"".[79]
Domestic policy[edit]
Yousaf will challenge the UK Government's section 35 order of the Gender Recognition Reform Bill.[80] During his first meeting with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, Yousaf requested a section 30 order to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence.[81][82] Sunak has rejected the request.[83]
Yousaf launches the fourth Building a New Scotland paperIn June 2023, Yousaf launched the fourth Building a New Scotland paper which focused on the constitution of an independent Scotland. Yousaf declared that there would be a written constitution for an independent Scotland, claiming that such a constitution would set a benchmark in which no future Scottish Government could fall short of as it would be a constitution enshrined into Scots law. Yousaf declared that the government had placed a commitment to a constitution that gave the population ""the right to access a system of healthcare free at the point of need, as well as rules on land ownership and environmental provisions"".[84] The previous three papers in the series were published by Yousaf's predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon.[85]Opposition parties in Scotland criticised Yousaf and the Scottish Government for ""focusing on the wrong priorities"". A spokesman for the UK Government said ""We want to work constructively with the Scottish government to tackle our shared challenges because that is what families and businesses in Scotland expect"" and that ""this is not the time to be talking about distracting constitutional change"".[84]On 27 July 2023, Yousaf launched the fifth paper in the Building a New Scotland series entitled Citizenship in an independent Scotland. The prospectus set out the Scottish Government's proposals for citizenship and passports in an independent Scotland, with the Scottish Government seeking to pursue an ""inclusive"" model similar to that in the Republic of Ireland. People born outside Scotland would automatically be entitled to Scottish citizenship under the plans if at least one of their parents were Scottish, and Scottish people resident in Scotland at the time of independence would be entitled to hold dual Scottish and British citizenship should be desire.[86] The paper commits and independent Scotland to remaining a member of the Common Travel Area, meaning that there would be no hard border between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom on land or at sea.[86] Scottish citizens would have the right to a Scottish passport on the day of independence, however, British passports held by Scots after independence would remain valid until their date or expiry.[86]
Economic policy[edit]
Yousaf meets with the International Monetary Fund's Gita Gopinath, June 2023Yousaf entered office amid the ongoing cost of living crisis.[87] He supports the introduction of the deposit return scheme, but not in its current form, suggesting it should exclude small businesses.[88] He has emphasised the need for a wellbeing economy and has proposed introducing a new wealth tax in order to raise money for more welfare benefits.[89][90]
Deposit Return Scheme[edit]
Yousaf accused the UK Government of placing the future of the Scottish Government's Deposit Return Scheme ""in grave danger"" in June 2023.[91] His comments came following a UK Government warning that it may block the inclusion of glass in the recycling scheme, and that policy surrounding deposit return schemes should be ""consistent UK wide"".[92] The intervention from the UK Government in an area of Scottish Government control sparked further consistutional tensions between Holyrood and Westminster, with Yousaf stating that the intervention is a ""major erosion of the devolution settlement"".[91]
Yousaf at a cabinet meeting in March 2023In early June 2023, Yousaf wrote to UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urging him to revoke the decision regarding the removal of glass from the deposit return scheme by Monday 5 June. In the letter, Yousaf claimed that ""the UK Government’s demands, including the removal of glass from DRS, would impact the environment, detrimentally affect businesses based in Scotland, and threaten the viability of the scheme"".[93]
Drugs policy[edit]
During the early days of his tenure as First Minister, Scotland's drugs death had fallen to its lowest levels in five years, however, it still had a higher drug death rate than the other countries of the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe.[94] As First Minister, Yousaf has advocated that the Scottish Government supports decriminalising drugs for personal use.[94] The Scottish Government has stated that they aim to provide 1,000 residential rehabilitation beds a year from 2026, prioritising spending more than £100 million on improving access to drug rehabilitation services.[94]Yousaf has argued that ""more radical approaches are needed to tackle drug deaths and addiction"" in Scotland on the backdrop of high levels of drug related deaths, despite a decline.[95] Yousaf urged the UK Government to examine the evidence surrounding drug rehabilitation rooms and to introduce such a facility in Glasgow, an area of Scotland's with considerably high drug related deaths and incidents.[95] However, the Home Office has repeatedly rejected calls that would see sites established where users can take drugs under the supervision of medical professionals. Despite a report published by the Westminster Home Affairs Committee that recommended the establishment of a pilot drug consumption room in Glasgow, the Home Office again rejected calls for such a pilot scheme to be commissioned, leading to intervention from the First Minister who urged the UK Government to look at the evidence highlighted in the Home Affairs Committee report, and if calls were consistently rejected, then powers for the creation of drug rehabilitation rooms should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.[95]
Education policy[edit]
Yousaf with a group of primary school children at the launch of the Reading Schools initiative, August 2023Yousaf was challenged to review the long running Scottish Government policy of free university tuition, with University of Edinburgh vice-chancellor Peter Mathieson saying that allowing wealthier families to pay was ""worthy of calm consideration"". Yousaf disputed calls for a review of the policy, saying that he was ""very proud"" of the SNP's long opposition to any fees for education in Scotland.[96] He highlighted his support and commitment to the continuation of free tuition in Scotland by saying he was ""absolutely committed to ensuring we have free education"" and that  ""university education should be on the ability to learn not the ability to pay"".[96]Yousaf was largely criticised for saying he would stop the roll out of free school meals in Scotland in favour of a more targeted approach. Yousaf was urged to reconsider this decision, with opponents arguing that the stop of the roll out would by a ""betrayal"" of children in Scotland.[97] Yousaf used his own daughter as an example, and argued as to whether his daughter should be entitled to free school meals considering Yousaf's high salary as First Minister of Scotland.[97] Opponents in the Scottish Parliament accused Yousaf of ""flip flopping"" over free school meals policy.[98] After mounting pressure on the backdrop of his statement, Yousaf pledged his support and commitment to free school meals and reaffirmed that the policy of free school meals in Scotland would not be ending and confirmed the Scottish Government's plans to introduce free school meals entitlement in secondary school, however, Yousaf did not provide a timescale for this delivery.[99]In August 2023, Yousaf launched the Reading Schools project, a replacement initiative of the First Minister's Reading Challenge which was established under Yousaf's predecessor Nicola Sturgeon. 371 schools across Scotland have become accredited as ""reading schools"", with the hope of an additional 511 schools looking to have joined the project in the future. This is ""an accreditation programme for schools that are committing to building a reading culture for their learners and communities"".[100] Yousaf has claimed that it is the intention of the Scottish Government to ""see every school in Scotland become part of the scheme in the next three to five years"" to promote and improve reading in Scottish schools.[101]
Views on international affairs[edit]
Yousaf with the Prime Minister of Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif, May 2023Yousaf entered office as First Minister on the backdrop of the Supreme Court ruling that the Scottish Government does not have the power to legislate for another referendum on Scottish independence.[102] His predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, had, prior to leaving office, published a series of Scottish Government papers on Scottish independence, titled Building a New Scotland.[103]In December 2023, Yousaf met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan without UK officials, leading Foreign Secretary David Cameron to issue a warning, threatening to withdraw FCDO support for Scottish ministers due to a breach of protocol.[104]
European Union[edit]
Yousaf's first international visit as First Minister was to Brussels in June 2023,[105] which, during a three day visit, sought to set out his ""vision for a meaningful and mutually beneficial relationship"" between Scotland and the European Union.[106] Yousaf declared his desire to set up a permanent Scottish Government envoy to the European Union in Brussels to ""aid the cause of independence"".[107][106] Yousaf used the visit to Brussels to reiterate the SNP's position on the European Union and future membership should Scotland become independent, citing that a majority of Scottish voters voted to remain a member of the European Union in the 2016 referendum on UK membership of the European Union. However, the Spanish Government has ""professed"" opposition to future Scottish membership of the European Union, citing fears that a future independent Scotland would lead to advancements in Catalonia's attempts for independence from Spain. Yousaf said that the Spanish Government made it ""abundantly clear"" and that he ""agrees with the Spanish Government - that the situation in Scotland and Catalonia are different"".[108]
Scotland–Pakistan relations[edit]
Yousaf and Prime Minister of Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif met in May 2023 in London, with both Yousaf and Sharif declaring a commitment to ""further strengthen historic ties between Pakistan and Scotland, including in the domains of trade, investment, education, water management, wind & solar technology and people to people links"".[109]
Ukraine invasion[edit]
Yousaf meets with Ukrainian ambassador Vadym PrystaikoDuring the SNP leadership bid, Yousaf was highly criticised and dubbed as ""embarrassing"" by asking ""where are all the men?"" when meeting a group of Ukrainian women.[110] The group of women explained to Yousaf that their husbands were in Ukraine continuing to engage in resistance to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yousaf told the BBC that there were in fact Ukrainian men in the building and that the group of women he had addressed the question to did not appear to take offence.[110]Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Scottish Liberal Democrats described the blunder as ""clumsy, insensitive and displays a real ignorance of international affairs"" from the ""man who is about to lead Scotland"".[110]In August 2023, Yousaf attended a wreath laying ceremony in Edinburgh to commemorate Ukraine's independence day. During the event, Yousaf reaffirmed Scotland's support towards Ukraine and stated that Scotland ""stands in absolute solidarity with Ukraine”. He also highlighted that Scotland had welcomed more than 25,000 Ukrainian people since the Russian invasion in February 2022.[111] He said that it was important for countries in Europe and around the world to continue to pledge their support for Ukraine and assist the Ukrainian efforts in any way possible, and that following the war, that those countries help Ukraine to rebuild.[111] Yousaf thanked the Ukrainians who had settled in Scotland for their contributions to Scotland and said that Scotland would be their home for as long as possibly needed.[111]
Israel–Hamas war[edit]
Yousaf condemned Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel.[112]He called for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war and criticized Israel's blockade and bombing of the Gaza Strip that killed thousands of Palestinian civilians, saying that ""Israel has a right to protect itself from terror, but that cannot be at the price of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with those attacks. That collective punishment has to be condemned.""[113][114] On 1 November 2023, he condemned Israel for the ""blatant disregard for human life"" after airstrikes on the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza.[115]He called on Home Secretary Suella Braverman to resign after she branded pro-Palestinian protesters ""hate marchers"" and far-right counter-protesters subsequently clashed with police in London.[116] Yousaf accused her of ""fanning the flames of division"".[117]
Programme for government[edit]
In September 2023, Yousaf launched his first Programme for Government. The programme for government focuses on reducing poverty, delivering economic growth, tackle climate change and provide high quality public services.[118]
Political positions[edit]
Yousaf in 2018Yousaf has been described as socially progressive.[119][64][120] He is a follower of his predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, and is in favour of continuing her socially progressive policies. This formed a major part of his leadership election campaign in March 2023, and he was successfully elected as Leader of the Scottish National Party.[121][122] He supports Scottish republicanism, stating: ""I believe we should be citizens first, not subjects."" He attended the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey in London on 6 May 2023.[123]As a member of the SNP, a pro-Scottish independence party, Yousaf voted ""Yes"" in the 2014 independence referendum.[124] He has supported the idea for holding a second referendum, often informally described as ""indyref2"".[125] Yousaf has raised concerns over using the next UK general election as a de facto referendum as it would not allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote.[126] He also believes another referendum should only be held if there is clear public support, stating ""It isn't good enough to have polls that put support for independence at 50 per cent or 51%.""[127][128]In 2020, Yousaf expressed support for increasing the racial diversity among top government positions in Scotland. He stated ""for 99% of the meetings I go to, I'm the only non-White person in the room ... . Every chair of every public body is White. That is not good enough.""[129] Yousaf said in 2023 that he was ""firmly committed to equality for everyone"" and has vocally supported same-sex marriage and gender reforms for trans people.[130] In 2014, he was absent for the final vote of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 due to a ministerial engagement, although he voted in favour of the bill in earlier stages.[131] He also voted in favour of the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill.[132] Additionally, Yousaf has vowed to secure the rights of LGBT community in a written constitution if Scotland gains independence.[133]On 24 June 2023, at an event at the Caird Hall in Dundee, Yousaf restated the SNP's intention of using the next general election as a de facto referendum to demand Scottish independence.[134] In October 2023 he announced that this would take the form of interpreting the SNP winning a majority of UK parliamentary seats in Scotland as a vote for independence.[135]

Personal life[edit]
Yousaf's family at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, 2023 (From left to right; his step-daughter, himself, his wife, Nadia, and mother Shaaista)Yousaf is a strong advocate of LGBT rights.[140] On the topic of marriage equality and homosexual sex he commented: ""I believe that people's marriage, if they are gay, and they are married, that their marriage is no more inferior, or worth less, than my marriage as a heterosexual individual. So no, I don't subscribe to that view (that gay sex is a sin).""[141] Amid controversy over Kate Forbes' religious views, Yousaf, a practising Muslim, said that he does not ""legislate on the basis of [his] faith"".[64]Yousaf was married to former SNP worker Gail Lythgoe from 2010 to 2016.[142][143] In 2019, he married psychotherapist Nadia El-Nakla and has one child and one stepchild.[144]In November 2016, Yousaf was fined £300 and had six penalty points added to his driving licence, after being caught by police driving a friend's car without being insured to drive it. Yousaf accepted full responsibility, saying: ""I totally accept the decision. I paid the fine and told my insurers about the points. This was an honest mistake, and the result of my personal circumstances during my separation.""[145]He and his second wife made a complaint of discrimination against a Dundee children's nursery that did not offer a place to their daughter in 2021. The complaint was upheld by the Care Inspectorate who found that the nursery ""did not promote fairness, equality and respect"" in terms of its admission policy.[146][147] The legal action was subsequently terminated by Yousaf and Nadia.[148]On 9 October 2023, Yousaf announced that his wife's parents were ""stuck"" in the Gaza Strip following the October 2023 Gaza−Israel conflict.[149] On 5 November, they were able to return to Scotland.[150]
Honours[edit]
He was sworn in as a member of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council on 17 May 2023 at Buckingham Palace.[151] Membership of the privy council is lifelong and members are addressed as ""The Right Honourable"".[152]See also[edit]

Personal detailsBorn (1957-06-07) 7 June 1957 (age 66)Edinburgh, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourSpouseGillianne McCormack[1]Alma materUniversity of EdinburghWebsitewww.iaingraymsp.co.ukIain Cumming Gray (born 7 June 1957) is a Scottish politician who served as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the East Lothian constituency from 2007 to 2021, having previously represented Edinburgh Pentlands from 1999 to 2003. 
A former aid worker and teacher of mathematics and physics, Gray was first elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as MSP for the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency, which he lost to Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party David McLetchie in 2003. Gray was returned to Holyrood in 2007 as MSP for East Lothian. Following Wendy Alexander's resignation as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2008, Gray stood at the subsequent leadership election, and was elected with a 57.8% share of the vote in the second round.
Initially, Gray oversaw some electoral successes for Scottish Labour, such as repelling SNP challenges at the Glenrothes (2008) and Glasgow North East (2009) by-elections, as well as seeing Scottish Labour retain all their 41 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election; despite the election overall resulting in the first UK hung parliament in 36 years, and the Labour Party being defeated after thirteen years in government. The 2011 Scottish Parliament election proved disastrous for the party, which lost 20 seats as the SNP won an outright majority of seats. Gray himself was only re-elected as MSP for East Lothian with a narrow majority of 151 votes. Gray announced his resignation the day after the result, but remained in post as leader until his successor, Johann Lamont, took over on 17 December 2011.
Due to his experience, Gray was appointed as Acting Leader of the Scottish Labour Party while a leadership and a deputy leadership election were being simultaneously held, on account of deputy leader Kezia Dugdale resigning to run for the leadership and the resignation of previous leader Jim Murphy after Scottish Labour's landslide defeat at the 2015 general election.

Early life and career[edit]
Gray was educated at the state comprehensive Inverness Royal Academy and briefly privately at George Watson's College, Edinburgh.[2] He studied physics at the University of Edinburgh before training as a teacher at Moray House College of Education.[2][3] After graduation, he worked as a mathematics and physics teacher at Gracemount High School in Edinburgh before a teaching stint in Mozambique.[4] He then spent twelve years as the campaigns director for the Scottish arm of the aid charity Oxfam.

Early political career[edit]
Gray as a government ministerHaving previously stood as a candidate in Lothian Regional Council elections, Gray was first elected to the devolved Scottish Parliament at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election.[5] Immediately after his election to Holyrood, he was made a deputy minister in the first Scottish Executive under Donald Dewar.
Following Jack McConnell becoming First Minister in 2001, Gray was promoted to Minister for Social Justice. After the sudden resignation of Wendy Alexander (following disagreements with McConnell) in 2002,[6] Gray took over her role as Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, where he was responsible for overseeing changes to Scottish higher education.
At the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Gray was defeated by Scottish Conservative leader David McLetchie, who he had stood against in 1999. Leaving Holyrood, he went to work in London as a special adviser to Alistair Darling, who was Secretary of State for Scotland, and initially announced that he would not be seeking re-election.[7]Having subsequently a change of mind, he was selected as the official Labour candidate for East Lothian for the 2007 election and subsequently won. Gray was appointed as Scottish Labour's Shadow spokesman for enterprise, energy and tourism upon his return to Holyrood.

Leader of the Scottish Labour Party[edit]
Following the resignation of Wendy Alexander over a foreign donation scandal,[8] Gray announced in July 2008 that he would stand in the contest to find the next Leader of the Labour group in the Scottish Parliament, and was elected to this post in September 2008.[9]In December 2010, Iain Gray sparked a diplomatic row when he appeared to claim in parliament that Montenegro had been involved in ethnic cleansing and war crimes during the 1990s Balkans Conflict.[10]On 7 April 2011, whilst campaigning at Glasgow Central station for the Scottish Parliament election, Gray was forced to cancel an event due to disruption by a group protesting against public spending cuts.[11] He quickly left the station and ran into a nearby Subway outlet to escape the protesters, who followed him into the shop and continued to heckle him.[11] Gray later stated that he had not been unsettled by the incident as ""I spent two years working in the civil war in Mozambique, I've been to Rwanda two months after the genocide, I walked the killing fields in Cambodia and I was in Chile three days after Pinochet was demitted from office"".[12]At the 2011 election, Labour suffered a net loss of seven seats, with many of their leading figures being defeated. Labour took a particularly severe beating in its Central Belt heartland, having to rely on regional lists in many cases. It was Labour's worst electoral performance in Scotland in eighty years. Gray himself was re-elected as MSP for East Lothian by the narrowest margin of his political career; with just 151 votes over the SNP candidate, making the Holyrood seat for the first time ever a Labour–SNP marginal. He announced on 6 May that he would stand down as party leader in the autumn.

Later political career[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011Gray was reappointed to the post of Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance in the Scottish Labour Shadow Cabinet on 29 June 2013. After the 2014 leadership election, he was made Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning.
On 13 June 2015, Gray was appointed Acting Leader of the Scottish Labour Party whilst a leadership and a deputy leadership election were simultaneously held, on account of deputy leader Kezia Dugdale resigning to run for the leadership.[13] At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, while several Labour MSPs lost their seats, Gray retained his seat with an increased majority compared to 2011.
Gray announced that he would be standing down at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election in June 2020, in order to spend more time with his family.[14]Gray nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[15]
Personal life[edit]
Gray has been married twice.[16] He is a lifelong fan of Edinburgh football club Hibernian,[17] and enjoys reading, music and hill walking. He is a member of the Church of Scotland.[18]

Personal detailsBorn (1953-11-23) 23 November 1953 (age 70)Prestwick, Ayrshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Labour PartySpouseElizabeth McAndrewChildren2ResidencePrestwickAlma materGlasgow UniversityOccupationCharity workerIan McWilliam Welsh OBE (born 23 November 1953) is a former Scottish Labour politician who works as Chief Executive of the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland. After a brief career as a professional footballer, he was an English teacher and became a local councillor, serving twice as a Council Leader. He was very narrowly elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Ayr in 1999 but resigned at the end of the year, disillusioned at his failure to achieve office and having decided that he was uncomfortable with the mode of politics.

Teaching career[edit]
Welsh was born and brought up in Prestwick, Ayrshire; he attended Prestwick Academy and Ayr Academy. He was a professional football player for Kilmarnock F.C.,[citation needed] but when his football career ended he studied English Literature and History at the University of Glasgow and obtained a Diploma in Educational Management at Jordanhill College. He was employed as an English teacher at the James Hamilton Academy in Kilmarnock in 1977. He moved on to Auchinleck Academy in 1980, and became deputy Head Teacher there in 1992.[1]
Local government[edit]
Welsh went into politics as a councillor for Prestwick ward on Kyle and Carrick District Council in 1984. From the late 1980s chaired the Prestwick Airport Steering Group; he campaigned alongside Scottish MPs to preserve the monopoly which Prestwick then enjoyed on cross-Atlantic flights from Scotland.[2] Welsh became council leader of Kyle and Carrick Council in 1990, holding office until Labour lost control of the council in 1992. In 1995 he was elected to South Ayrshire Council, and served as Leader of the Council until 1999. He left teaching in 1997 and after briefly working as Director of Human Resources and Public Affairs for Prestwick Airport, was appointed Chief Executive of Kilmarnock F.C.[1]
MSP for Ayr[edit]
In the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in May 1999, Welsh won the seat of Ayr by just 25 votes (0.07%) ahead of the Conservative and Unionist candidate, Phil Gallie. The seat was the most marginal of the election, and there had to be two full recounts.[3] He was named as member of the Education, Culture and Sport committee of the Parliament. In November 1999 he cautioned the members of the committee not to intervene in delicate negotiations over funding of Hampden Park before it had a full briefing from the Minister responsible.[4]
Resignation[edit]
An assessment of the performance of each MSP by The Herald newspaper published in the middle of December 1999 noted that Welsh was only on leave of absence from being Chief Executive of Kilmarnock F.C., and said that he was ""clearly finding the transition to 'humble' back bencher a bit hard"".[5] A week later, Welsh suddenly resigned his seat, explaining that the decision came after ""considerable heart searching and extended family debate"".[6] After press speculation that he was disappointed not to have achieved high office, Welsh wrote an article explaining that as a council leader he delivered ""real service to constituents, rather than the threadbare and raddled soundbites of politicians who promise everything and deliver nothing"".[7] At 230 days after election, he was the first MSP to resign from the job. The subsequent by-election was won by John Scott for the Conservatives, gaining the party their first ever constituency seat in the Scottish Parliament.

Later career[edit]
Welsh returned to his post as Chief Executive of Kilmarnock F.C., but in July 2001 was appointed as Chief Executive of Rehab Scotland.[8] He was Chief Executive of Momentum Scotland, a charity providing rehabilitation and training for disabled people, from 2001 to 2007. He was also Chairman of Borderline Theatre Company from 2002 to 2007, and became chairman of AUFA in 2007. He was Director of UK Services for the Rehab Group from 2007 to 2011.[1] He is Chief Executive of the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland.[9]

She contested the seat of Dundee West in the 2003 election, where she narrowly lost to the Labour incumbent Kate Maclean.[4]

Personal detailsBornJack Wilson McConnell (1960-06-30) 30 June 1960 (age 63)Irvine, Ayrshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourSpouseBridget McLuckie ​(m. 1990)​Children2Alma materUniversity of StirlingProfessionTeacher (Mathematics)Cabinet1st 2ndSignatureJack Wilson McConnell, Baron McConnell of Glenscorrodale, PC (born 30 June 1960) is a Scottish politician who served as First Minister of Scotland and Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland from 2001 to 2007. McConnell served as the Minister for Finance from 1999 to 2000 and Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs from 2000 to 2001. He has been a Labour life peer in the House of Lords since 2010 and previously served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Motherwell and Wishaw from 1999 to 2011.
Born in Irvine, Ayrshire, McConnell studied at the University of Stirling and worked as a mathematics teacher at Lornshill Academy. His political career began when he was elected to the Stirling District Council, while he was still teaching. He served as a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, having campaigned in-favour for a Scottish Parliament in the 1997 devolution referendum. Elected to serve as an MSP for the Motherwell and Wishaw constituency in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, McConnell was appointed Minister for Finance under the Donald Dewar government. After Dewar's death in 2000, he ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland, having been defeated by Henry McLeish. McLeish appointed McConnell as Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs.
In 2001, McLeish resigned in the aftermath of the Officegate scandal and McConnell was elected unopposed as the Scottish Labour leader. He was appointed First Minister on 22 November 2001, becoming the youngest office holder. As first minister, he implemented a ban on smoking in public places, signed a Co-operation Agreement with Malawi, and successfully bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games to be hosted in Glasgow. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the Labour Party in Scotland became the second largest party, with the SNP having one seat more. This therefore lead to McConnell losing office, becoming the first First Minister to have been defeated from office.
After losing office as first minister, McConnell sat as the Leader of the Opposition in Holyrood, until his resignation as leader. He sat as a backbencher and stood down as an MSP in the 2011 election. In 2010, McConnell became a member of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom. He made a commitment to continuing his work to tackle poverty in Africa and to develop the relationship between Scotland and Malawi.[1]

vteEarly life and education[edit]
Jack Wilson McConnell was born on 30 June 1960 in Irvine, Ayrshire.[2][3] He is the eldest of four children born to William Wilson McConnell (1937–2018)[4][5] and Elizabeth McCallum McConnell (née Jack; 1936–2020).[6][7] McConnell was brought up on Glenscorrodale Farm near Lamlash on the Isle of Arran, where his father was a sheep farmer and a member of the  Arran Farmer’s Society.[8][9][10] He was educated at Lamlash Primary and Arran High School.[11]McConnell attended the University of Stirling, where he was President of the Students' Association from 1980 to 1982 and National Union of Students Scotland Vice-President from 1982 to 1983.[12] He met Margo MacDonald and Richard Leonard at university.[13] In the late 1970s, he occupied the principal's office in protest against student homelessness. He also took part in a siege to occupy the administration offices at the university and slept in sleeping bags in the university’s court room.[13] He graduated in 1983 with a BSc Dip Ed.[14]
Early career[edit]
After graduating, McConnell worked as a mathematics teacher at Lornshill Academy in Alloa, Clackmannanshire.[15] In 1984, McConnell was elected to the Stirling District Council, while still teaching at Lornshill.[16] He served as Treasurer from 1988 until 1992, and was the Leader of the council from 1990 to 1992.[17]
Political career[edit]
Early political involvement[edit]
McConnell initially joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) when he was 16 years old. After trying to come to terms with Scottish nationalism, he suspended his membership and instead joined the Scottish Labour Party when he was 19.[13]From 1992 to 1998, McConnell served as the General Secretary of the Labour Party in Scotland.[16][17] His major breakthrough was in his handling of the 1997 General Election success, where Labour attained a large overall majority victory over the Conservatives. Together the Labour Party in Scotland, the Scottish Liberal Democrats, and the Scottish National Party eliminated every seat the Conservatives held in Scotland. In 1998, he served as a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention where he pioneered the Scottish devolution referendum success, establishing the Scottish Parliament.[citation needed]As a strong proponent of Scottish devolution, McConnell helped push for reform. Between 1989 and 1998 he was a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, where he was playing an important role in the creation of the Scotland Act, which created a Scottish Parliament for the first time.[citation needed]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
As General Secretary, he managed Labour Party in Scotland's successful YES YES devolution referendum campaign in 1997. Following the successful devolution campaign and the creation of a Scottish Parliament, McConnell was elected as an MSP, for Motherwell and Wishaw, in the first Scottish Parliament in May 1999.[citation needed]
McConnell, seated second on the right, as a member of the Dewar administration, June 1999Finance Minister; 1999–2000[edit]
He was appointed immediately by Donald Dewar, the then First Minister, to the post of Minister of Finance. As Finance Minister one of his primary jobs was to establish the budgeting procedures for the new Scottish government, which included consulting the public on budget priorities. As Minister responsible for External Relations he established Concordats with the UK Government and opened Scotland House in Brussels.[citation needed]McConnell was elected an MSP in the first Scottish Parliament elections in 1999. He was appointed Minister for Finance in the new Scottish Executive by then First Minister Donald Dewar. One of his first moves as Finance Minister was to establish the budgeting procedures for the new Scottish Executive, including publishing a consultation document asking the public and MSPs how the budget should be spent. His department also passed the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 through Parliament, which set out the finance and auditing procedures of the Executive.[18]
Education Minister; 2000–2001[edit]
On 11 October 2000, Dewar died of a brain haemorrhage. After the Labour leadership intervened to stop the Enterprise Minister Henry McLeish being appointed Dewar's successor without a vote, McConnell stood in the leadership contest. The election was held on Saturday 21 October, only 72 hours after Dewar's funeral, and the surprise result saw McConnell defeated with 36 votes to McLeish's 44 votes.[19]McLeish appointed him Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs.[20] Some analysts considered this post to be a ""poisoned chalice"", as he would be required to resolve both a crisis in the Scottish Qualifications Authority over exam marking, and pay disputes with the teaching unions.[21]
Leadership of the Scottish Labour Party[edit]
McLeish resigned as first minister on 8 November 2001 over the Officegate scandal, regarding the sub let of his constituency office.[22][23] McConnell was seen by many political analysts as the likely successor and he later launched his bid for leader.[24][25][26] On 13 November, McConnell made a press conference in Edinburgh after reports emerged he had an extra-marital affair seven years prior.[27][28] He admitted to having an affair and in a statement with his wife, Bridget McConnell, he stated: ""If I become first minister, it would be very wrong for my family or anybody else to suffer because my behaviour then is still a secret today. That is why we are now being open about the fact that I did have an affair seven years ago. At the time I made mistakes, including denying the facts publicly and privately"".[29][30]McConnell emerged as the only candidate and on 17 November, he was officially elected unopposed as Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland after receiving the support of 97.23% of MSPs.[31] In his acceptance speech, he stated he was ""deeply honoured to receive such overwhelming support"" and highlighted that much work still needed to be done ""to make devolution a success"" and achieve ""first class public services"".[32]
First Minister of Scotland (2001–2007)[edit]
Main article: Premiership of Jack McConnell
First term; 2001–2003[edit]
See also: First McConnell government
McConnell with President of Russia Vladimir Putin in Edinburgh, June 2003McConnell was nominated for the post of First Minister by a vote of the Scottish Parliament on 22 November, defeating Scottish National Party leader John Swinney, Scottish Conservative leader David McLetchie and Independent MSP Dennis Canavan by 70 votes to 34, 19 and 3 respectively.[33][34] On 27 November, the Queen issued him a Royal Warrant of Appointment and he was sworn in at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.[35] As a result of him becoming First Minister, he was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland and to the Privy Council, earning the title 'The Right Honourable' for life.[36][37] McConnell continued to led the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition that had existed under the Dewar and McLeish administrations.

Cabinet appointments[edit]
See also: First McConnell government
Shortly after being appointed McConnell began making appointments to his cabinet. Jim Wallace remained in the post of deputy first minister while Cathy Jamieson took over Mr McConnell's education brief and Wendy Alexander and Ross Finnie remained as ministers. Sam Galbraith and Angus MacKay stood down and Jackie Baillie, Sarah Boyack and Tom McCabe reshuffled out of government, while Susan Deacon was offered the post of social justice minister but refused the offer and moved to the backbenches. Cathy Jamieson, Mike Watson, Malcolm Chisholm, Iain Gray, Patricia Ferguson and Andy Kerr were all promoted to cabinet.[38]
Sporting event bids[edit]
In February 2002, Scotland joined forces with the Republic of Ireland in a bid to host the 2008 European Football Championship.[39] McConnell was initially unconvinced that it was worth spending around £100 million on the tournament,[40] but he later put his support behind the joint bid with the Irish.[41]Although the bid lost out to Austria/Switzerland, McConnell later supported other attempts to land major supporting events including London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games[42] and Glasgow's bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.[43]
Sectarianism[edit]
In December 2002, McConnell launched his government's campaign against sectarianism.[44]

See also: Second McConnell government
McConnell was re elected MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw at the Scottish Parliament elections. The Labour Party in Scotland won 50 seats, the largest number, and formed another coalition government with the Liberal Democrats which won 17 seats. On 15 May, McConnell was re appointed First Minister of Scotland and on the same day the Scottish government published A Partnership for a Better Scotland which set out the government's priorities for the four-year term ahead.[citation needed]This was followed by the “Fresh Talent initiative” which was created and developed to focus at addressing the demographic decline in Scotland and ageing Scottish population by attracting young and skilled immigrants, primarily from other European Union countries (such as Poland and Slovakia primarily) to be attracted to Scotland as a place to live and work.

Public smoking ban[edit]
One of McConnell's most famous achievements during his tenure in government was the successful campaign to ban smoking in Scottish public places, such as pubs, public transport and restaurants, making Scotland the first country within the United Kingdom to do so, which lead to McConnell receiving praise for his leadership on this issue, ultimately leading other countries to follow.[45]McConnell attended the 31st G8 summit which was held in Gleneagles Hotel, Scotland, and welcomed guests invited to the conference to Glasgow Prestwick Airport on arrival.

2007 Scottish election[edit]
The Scottish Parliament general election of 3 May 2007 saw McConnell re elected as the MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw with a majority of 5,938 votes, representing 48% of the vote with a turnout of 50.3%. The Labour Party in Scotland was defeated by the SNP with the SNP winning 47 seats to Labour's 46, leaving the SNP short of an overall majority in the Parliament.[46]
Post premiership[edit]
Labour in opposition; 2007–2011[edit]
Leader of the Opposition[edit]
As Labour was left the second largest party in Holyrood, the SNP was invited first to form a government.[47] The Lib Dems turned down a coalition deal with the SNP and Scottish Greens and ruled out a deal with Labour.[48][49] On 16 May 2007, the election to nominate a first minister in the Scottish Parliament was held, with Alex Salmond receiving 49 votes to 46, as the Lib Dems and Conservatives abstained.[50][51] The following day, the SNP officially formed the first nationalist administration of the Scottish Executive and McConnell became Leader of the Opposition.[52][53]
McConnell as Leader of the Opposition listening to Alex Salmond's acceptance speech, May 2007On 17 May 2007, McConnell told Salmond he would abstain in a Parliament vote to appoint ministers. In his first speech as opposition leader, McConnell listed a series of 'hypocritical' remarks that SNP ministers had made about the Labour administration.[54]
My predecessor had problems over a muddle. I can only describe Mr Salmond's first decisions as a guddle. He has learned nothing in opposition, despite what he said about doing so. He will regret deprioritising culture, sport and housing, but those who value them will regret it more. Those who want to see action on affordable homes will regret it too.— McConnell's response to Alex Salmond's administration
As Leader of the Opposition in Holyrood, McConnell took part in First Minister's Questions (FMQs). In one session of FMQs, he claimed the new SNP administration was making several U-turns on transport policy and its position on student debt and council taxes.[55]
Resignation as leader[edit]
On 15 August 2007, McConnell announced his intention to resign as Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland.[56] In a statement, he said it was his ""honour"" to serve as leader and empathised the need for Labour to learn lessons following its defeat in May.[57][58] Immediately after his resignation, he was nominated by Prime Minister Gordon Brown to succeed Richard Wildash as British High Commissioner to Malawi.[59] McConnell was succeeded as leader by Wendy Alexander.[60]
Backbench MSP[edit]
After his resignation, McConnell sat in Labour's opposition backbenches at Holyrood and continued to represent his Motherwell and Wishaw constituency until the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. On 28 May 2010, it was announced that McConnell would be made a life peer and enter the House of Lords as a working peer on behalf of the Labour Party.[61]
House of Lords; 2010–present[edit]
Lord McConnell speaking at the Girls Education Forum, 2016On 28 June 2010, he was created a life peer as Baron McConnell of Glenscorrodale, of the Isle of Arran in Ayrshire and Arran,[62] and was introduced in the House of Lords the same day.[63] In August 2010 he announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the Scottish Parliament.[64]
Other positions[edit]
In August 2007, he was appointed an adviser to the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative in Malawi and Rwanda, and in October 2008, he was appointed by Gordon Brown as the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Conflict Resolution Mechanisms, a position which ceased following Labour's defeat in the 2010 General election.[citation needed]He is a UK Ambassador for Action for Children; a Fellow of the 48 Group Club, which promotes relationships between the United Kingdom and China and an Ambassador for Pump Aid. On 8 March 2012, Optical Express announced the appointment of Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale joining the Board as non executive director.[65] He was a non executive director at DCM (Optical Holdings) from 2011 to 2015.[66] As of 30 November 2018, McConnell holds the position of Chancellor at the University of Stirling.[67]
Personal life[edit]
In 1990, McConnell married to Bridget McConnell, a cultural administrator and former Chief Executive Officer of Glasgow Life.[68][69] They met in the late 1980s, where they both worked in Stirling District Council.[70] On 5 March 1991, a sheriff ruled McConnell could become the legal father of Bridget's children, Hannah and Mark; whom she had in her previous marriage with Richard Brown.[71] During McConnell's leadership bid for the Scottish Labour Party in November 2001, he revealed in a press conference that he had been involved in an extra marital affair seven years previously.[72] He admitted the affair had been ""an open secret for seven years"" and ""It caused significant hurt to a number of people and I regret that very much to this day"".[73][74]In 2016, McConnell refused to bail out his sister, Anne McConnell, who was jailed for stealing £9,000 from a disabled pensioner's bank account.[75] She told police she needed money to pay her mortgage and blamed her crime on her menopause and hoped ""Jack would help her pay it back"".[75][76]

Personal detailsBornJacqueline Marie Barnes (1964-01-15) 15 January 1964 (age 59)British Hong KongPolitical partyLabourSpouseStephen Baillie ​(m. 1982)​Children1Alma materNew College LanarkshireUniversity of StrathclydeUniversity of GlasgowWebsiteOfficial websiteDame Jacqueline Marie Baillie DBE (née Barnes; born 15 January 1964) is a politician who has served as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party since 2020. She has been Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Dumbarton constituency since 1999. She also served as acting Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2017 and again in 2021.
Born in British Hong Kong, Baillie was educated at St Anne's School, Windermere before studying at Cumbernauld College and the University of Strathclyde. After working in local government, she was elected at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election and served in the Scottish Executive as Minister for Social Justice under Henry McLeish. In December 2014, she was appointed as Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Finance, Constitution and Economy; later Economy, Jobs and Fair Work.
After Kezia Dugdale resigned as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party and acting leader Alex Rowley was suspended, Baillie served as acting leader until Richard Leonard was elected as Scottish Labour leader in 2017. She was sacked by Leonard as economy spokesperson in October 2018, who also replaced her in the role. After she was elected Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Leonard reappointed Baillie to his Shadow Cabinet as Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Finance in April 2020. She again served as acting Scottish Labour leader for six weeks following Leonard's resignation in January 2021 and has been described by journalist Alex Massie as someone ""who both loves to wind-up the SNP and is good at it"".[1]
Early life and career[edit]
Baillie was born on 15 January 1964 in British Hong Kong to Sophie and Frank Barnes.[2] Her mother is Scottish and her father Portuguese. After education at the private St Anne's School, Windermere in the Lake District, she studied at Cumbernauld College and the University of Strathclyde. She went on to work as a resource centre manager at Strathkelvin District Council and a community economic development manager at East Dunbartonshire Council.[3]
Political career[edit]
Scottish Executive: 1999–2007[edit]
Baillie was chair of Scottish Labour in 1997.[3] She was first elected at the inaugural election for the Scottish Parliament in May 1999. A member of the Scottish Executive, she served as Minister for Social Justice when Henry McLeish was First Minister of Scotland, during which time she was involved with the Homelessness Task Force.[4] She was re-elected in 2003 and became a member of the Scottish Parliament's Justice 2 Committee and Public Petitions Committee. She supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[5][6]
Opposition: 2007–2020[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011In December 2007, Baillie defended Labour leader Wendy Alexander on Newsnight Scotland, during the controversy regarding alleged illegal donations to Alexander's leadership campaign.[7]In 2009, Baillie successfully brought into being an act of the Scottish Parliament, with the unanimous support of all MSPs, to allow for greater protection of disabled parking spaces.
Baillie has opposed minimum pricing of alcohol, being unconvinced about the overall benefits.[8] In 2010, she stated it would not be the best way of tackling the country's alcohol-related problems but instead backed a tax-based alternative amongst other measures.[9] The legislation was passed setting a minimum unit pricing floor price for a unit of alcohol of 50 pence per unit.[10]Baillie held the position of Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Health in the Shadow Cabinet of Iain Gray, retaining the post in December 2011 following the election of Johann Lamont as Gray's successor.[11][12] When Lamont announced a major shakeup of the Labour frontbench team on 28 June 2013, Baillie was moved from Health to Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Social Justice and Welfare.[13]On 27 March 2014, Baillie stood in for Johann Lamont at First Minister's Questions while Lamont was attending the funeral of veteran Labour politician Tony Benn.[14] She also stood in at FMQs following Lamont's resignation as Labour leader in October 2014.[15] Baillie ruled herself out of standing in the leadership election that followed Lamont's departure, stating that she wanted a ""supporting role"" rather than to be Labour leader.[16]As a backbench MSP, Baillie campaigned for a public inquiry into a lethal outbreak of Clostridium difficile colitis at the Vale of Leven Hospital in her constituency. The inquiry into the outbreak cost £10 million, while the families were offered £1 million, something which prompted Baillie to plead Health Secretary Shona Robison for greater compensation for those affected, during a session of the Scottish Parliament in November 2014.[17]In December 2017, Baillie was reduced to tears when raising the concern of fire safety following the deaths of two men in the Cameron House Hotel Fire.[18]After Kezia Dugdale resigned as Scottish Labour leader in August 2017 and interim leader Alex Rowley was suspended, Baillie served as acting leader until Richard Leonard was elected as the new leader following the 2017 Scottish Labour leadership election. Baillie continued to serve as Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work until October 2018 when she was sacked by Leonard, who also replaced her in the role.

Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party: 2020–present[edit]
In January 2020, Baillie announced that she would be standing as a candidate for the post of Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.[19] On 3 April, it was announced she had won the contest by 10,311 votes to Matt Kerr's 7,528 votes.[20] After she was elected, Leonard reappointed her to his frontbench as Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Finance. She served as acting Leader of the Scottish Labour Party since after the resignation of Leonard on 14 January 2021 and served until the election of Anas Sarwar as leader.
On 1 March 2021, Baillie was moved from shadowing Finance to Health, Social Care and Equalities.[21]Between 2020 and 2021, Baillie was a member of Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints that concluded that the Scottish Government's handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond was ""seriously flawed"".[22][23] As a committee member, Baillie quizzed both Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, asking the latter: ""You have described these errors as catastrophic. That's a strong word, tell me why then nobody has resigned? Nobody has taken responsibility of this, because at the heart of this two women have been let down.""[24] Former BBC journalist Andrew Neil said of Baillie's questioning, ""As a professional interviewer... there were many times when I thought Jackie Baillie was the only one that knew the questions to ask.""[25]On 19 March 2021, the findings of the committee were pre-emptively leaked to the media by an MSP. Baillie backed an inquiry into the leak and said: ""The leaks against the women were particularly bad, because they had the bravery to come forward to speak to the committee. It was entirely inappropriate that that information was leaked to the public domain.""[26]In the run up to the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, former SNP Depute Leader Jim Sillars donated £2,000 to her campaign to be re-elected. “I would prefer her in the parliament to a clone on the backbenches,"" Sillars said. ""I don’t think there is any doubt she is an asset to the parliament. My concern, in donating to Jackie Baillie, was to have a very able person in parliament.""[27]Ballie was re-elected in May 2021 with an increased majority of 1,483, with Dumbarton becoming the only seat to have voted Labour for the entirety of the devolved era.[28] After her victory, she told her constituents: ""You want a recovery, not a referendum. You want us to prioritise your jobs, the economy, the NHS. You want us to make sure that our kids at school have all the opportunities they deserve. I pledge to you that I will do that in this next parliament.""[29]Baillie was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for political and public service.[30]
Personal life[edit]
Baillie married Stephen Baillie in 1982.[2] They are now divorced. She lives in Dumbarton with her daughter. During her time as MSP, she studied for a Master of Science degree in Local Economic Development at the University of Glasgow.[3]

Personal detailsBornDavid Jackson Carlaw (1959-04-12) 12 April 1959 (age 64)Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesChildren2EducationThe Glasgow AcademyWebsitewww.jacksoncarlaw.org.ukDavid Jackson Carlaw CBE (born 12 April 1959) is a Scottish politician who served as Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party from 2019 to 2020. He previously served as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party from 2011 to 2019. He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 2007, first as an additional member for the West Scotland region and later for the Eastwood constituency since 2016.
Raised in Newton Mearns, Carlaw worked as a car salesman after education at The Glasgow Academy. Elected to the Scottish Parliament on the West of Scotland regional list in 2007 and 2011, he was elected as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party in the 2011 deputy leadership election. He was subsequently made Scottish Conservative Spokesperson for Health and Sport. He was elected to the constituency of Eastwood in 2016, which had contested previously in 2003, 2007, and 2011, and following the election was made Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Europe and External Affairs and Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Culture and Tourism.
Carlaw served as acting Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party from September 2018 to May 2019 during Ruth Davidson's maternity leave and from August 2019 to February 2020 following Davidson's resignation as leader. He was elected Scottish Conservative leader in the February 2020 leadership election, winning more than three-quarters of votes from party members. He resigned the leadership in July 2020, stating he was not the person best placed to lead the party into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.

Early life and career[edit]
Carlaw was raised in Newton Mearns and privately educated at The Glasgow Academy.[1] He worked for 25 years as a car salesman and was joint head of FirstFord car dealership in the west of Scotland until it was placed into receivership in November 2002.[2] He was also a director of Wylies automotive services until it went into administration in February 2003.[3]
Political career[edit]
Carlaw joined the East Renfrewshire Conservatives in 1978. He was the Conservative candidate in the 1982 Queen's Park by-election, and in the 1983 general election in Glasgow Pollok. He was Chairman of the Scottish Young Conservatives from 1984 to 1986, Chairman of Eastwood Conservatives from 1988 to 1992, and was Deputy Chairman of the Scottish Conservatives from 1992 to 1998. He was reappointed Deputy Chairman of the Scottish Conservatives in 2005.[4]In the run-up to the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum Carlaw campaigned against the formation of a devolved Scottish Parliament alongside the Scottish Conservatives and the Think Twice campaign, advocating a No vote for both the question of the parliament's formation and whether the parliament should be granted tax-varying powers.[5][6]Carlaw was unsuccessful as a candidate for Eastwood in the 2003, 2007, and 2011 Scottish Parliament elections. He was, however, elected on the party list under Scotland's additional member system in 2007 and 2011, representing the West of Scotland region. He sat on the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament until mid-2018.[7]In 2011, Carlaw stood as a candidate in the leadership election brought on by Annabel Goldie's resignation. During the campaign, he was hospitalised with appendicitis.[8] Carlaw finished third behind Ruth Davidson and Murdo Fraser.[9] He was appointed as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party and Scottish Conservative Spokesperson for Health and Sport by Davidson following her victory.[10]Carlaw became MSP for Eastwood in 2016, after defeating the incumbent Ken Macintosh. He was re-appointed as of 28 June 2017 as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Europe and External Affairs and Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Culture and Tourism. He supported remain during the 2016 EU referendum.[11] In September 2016, he was elected Convener of the Scottish Parliament's Cross Party Group on Building Bridges with Israel, the establishment of which he pledged to help in his 2016 election campaign.
Carlaw opposed the SNP's changes to council tax in November 2016, believing the proposed changes would effectively put over 50% of property in East Renfrewshire in the top two council tax bands. Commenting against the decision, he maintained ""the rise would unfairly hit working families and the elderly"" and ""will hit Eastwood residents hard"".[12]In February 2017, Carlaw was appointed Deputy Convener of the Cross Party Group on End-of-life Choices.
Following an attempt in March 2017 by the SNP to hold a second Scottish independence referendum, Carlaw spoke against the attempt, describing it as ""pointless"" and unwanted"". He pledged the Scottish Conservatives would not allow for a further referendum until the Scottish public showed clear support.[13]
Leader of the Scottish Conservatives[edit]
Carlaw (left) and Ruth Davidson (right) on the Scottish Conservative frontbench in 2018Carlaw served as acting leader of the Scottish Conservatives while leader Ruth Davidson was on maternity leave from September 2018 until May 2019. Following her resignation in August 2019, he was appointed to serve a second term.[14][15] In his role as acting leader, he supported Brexit and u-turned on criticisms of Prime Minister and Conservative leader Boris Johnson.[11] He was the incumbent when Johnson called the 2019 general election, in which the party lost seven of their 13 seats from 2017.[16]On 6 January 2020, Carlaw confirmed his candidacy for the February 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election[17] and launched his campaign in Edinburgh on 15 January. He received support from Ruth Davidson,[18] Murdo Fraser,[19]Adam Tomkins,[20]Liz Smith,[21]Annie Wells and Jamie Greene.[22] This gave Carlaw the position of favourite over his opponent Michelle Ballantyne. He centred his campaign around how he could beat Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in the next Scottish Parliament election and the local elections in 2022. He also promised to make the Scottish Conservatives more for the middle and working classes and continue to maintain the Scottish Conservatives as the main party of the Union.[22] Carlaw won the election with 4,917 votes in his favour, as opposed to 1,581 for Ballantyne.[23] He promised to provide a ""clear, focused and ambitious alternative to the SNP"".[24]During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Scottish Greens accused Carlaw in June 2020 of claiming an ""outright falsehood"" when he said the Scottish Parliament could be opened up quickly in order to hold the SNP government to account.[25] He initially supported the position of Boris Johnson to stick by Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings after alleged lockdown breaches but withdrew his support following criticism from leading figures in the Scottish party.[26]On 30 July 2020, Carlaw announced his resignation as Leader of the Scottish Conservatives, stating he had reached the ""simple if painful conclusion"" he was not ""the person best placed"" to lead the party into the next Scottish Parliament election, in 2021.[27] He was succeeded by Douglas Ross.[28]
Post-leadership[edit]
At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election Carlaw was re-elected as MSP for Eastwood with an increased majority of 2,216 votes over the SNP, with his share of the vote increasing by 6.2%.[29] Polling expert John Curtice put Carlaw's victory down to tactical voting by unionist voters who had voted Labour in 2016.[30]In December 2022, Carlaw was found to have breached the MSP code of conduct by not declaring a paid trip to Israel that was funded by the Israeli Embassy.[31]
Personal life[edit]
Carlaw lives in Waterfoot, East Renfrewshire. He is married and has two sons.[32]

Personal detailsBorn (1953-03-17) 17 March 1953 (age 70)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyWebsiteOfficial biography at The Scottish Parliament's websiteJames Dornan (born 17 March 1953) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who is Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Cathcart.
Raised in the Oatlands neighbourhood of southern Glasgow,[1] Dornan joined the Scottish National Party in 1996[2] and previously worked for Stewart Maxwell (MSP).[3]He was elected in the 2011 Parliamentary elections,[4] having previously contested the Ayr Constituency in the 2003 Scottish Parliament elections and the Glasgow South-West Constituency in the 2005 UK general election before his election in 2011.[3] He was also selected to be the SNP candidate in the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election, but decided to step aside after it was reported that he may have breached charity law by acting as an ""unpaid"" partner-director of Culture and Sport Glasgow while he was covered by a protected trust deed - an arrangement which avoids a court-ordered bankruptcy.[5]He represented the Langside ward on Glasgow City Council from 3 May 2007[6] until 3 May 2012[7] and was the SNP group leader on the council until June 2011, when he was succeeded by Councillor Allison Hunter.[8]In 2012, Dornan was appointed as a SNP Depute Whip.[9]On 25 February 2020, Dornan announced he would not be standing at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[10] However, in July 2020, he reversed his decision and announced that he would put himself forward again for election.[11] Later in July 2020, the SNP National Executive Committee voted have an all-woman shortlist for the Glasgow Cathcart Scottish Parliamentary constituency, ending his bid of standing for the seat again. However, after the decision, Dornan announced that he would challenge the decision.[12] The SNP National Secretary then reversed the all-woman shortlist and Dornan was permitted to stand. Dornan was selected to stand for the SNP in the Glasgow Cathcart Scottish Parliamentary constituency and held the seat with 57% of the vote.
Dornan believes in Scottish independence and has often appeared on Kremlin propaganda station RT to champion the cause.[13][14]
Controversies[edit]
In May 2019, Dornan was accused of homophobia after using the word 'fag' to describe a gay Conservative MP, Ross Thomson.[15] The Scottish Conservatives complained that ""Dornan has form when it comes to making crass and offensive remarks"" and he apologised for his use of language.[15]In June 2021 Dornan accused Lothian Buses of sectarianism after the bus cancelled scheduled services on St Patrick's Day. In fact, the bus company's services had been suspended because of anti-social behaviour. Conservative MSP Sue Webber described the remarks as ""completely false and poisonous"" and urged him to apologise. After pressure from SNP councillors in Edinburgh, Dornan apologised privately to the bus company for his mistake.[16][17]In July 2021 Dornan was reported to the Ethical Standards Commissioner after commenting on a post by Conservative cabinet minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg. Rees-Mogg, a practising Catholic, had tweeted about his visit to the Border Force National Command Centre and the British Government's Nationality and Borders Bill. In response Dornan tweeted:

Hope you remember this the next time you go to confession. You and your cronies are already responsible for the deaths of thousands and you’re now happy to see the most desperate people in the world suffer and drown. If your god exists you will undoubtedly rot in hell.[18][19][20]
The SNP later apologised to Rees-Mogg, who said it was ""most gracious"", adding:

But I think this SNP MSP is entitled to discuss the likely prospects of my immortal soul. It’s quite interesting that you're getting the discussion of hell in public life. I think that is theologically interesting concept and I'm glad he takes such an orthodox, Catholic view of the reality of that and that is encouraging.[21]
In February 2022 BBC journalist Sarah Smith said she was relieved to have escaped the ""bile, hatred and misogyny"" she had endured covering Scottish politics, having moved to Washington to serve as the BBC's North America Editor. She recounted one instance in which someone shouted at her from their car, ""What f***ing lies you’re going to be telling on TV tonight, you f***ing lying bitch?"" Dornan tweeted “America would be the go to place to escape all her imaginary woes then.”[22] The comment was widely condemned by his political opponents and Dornan later tweeted an apology, “for my earlier comments that made it seem as though I believed the abuse Sarah Smith has suffered was imaginary”. Conservative MSP Russell Findlay, a former crime reporter who had acid thrown at his face by a gangster, accused Dornan of “gaslighting” Smith and warned, “Cowardly attacks on journalists by the lunatic brigade in Scotland have become increasingly toxic since 2014. There's a risk that personal abuse escalates and that someone will get hurt.""[23]

   ​ ​(m. 1974)​Children4ParentsDouglas Douglas-HamiltonLady Elizabeth PercyAlma materBalliol College, OxfordUniversity of Edinburgh (LL.B.)James Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, Baron Selkirk of Douglas, PC, KC (31 July 1942 – 28 November 2023) was a Scottish Conservative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburgh West and then as a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothians region. Between 1997 and 2023 he was a member of the House of Lords as a life peer.
In 1994, he was briefly Earl of Selkirk, but disclaimed that peerage to remain in the House of Commons.

Early life[edit]
James Alexander Douglas-Hamilton was born at Dungavel House on 31 July 1942, to the 14th Duke of Hamilton and the former Lady Elizabeth Percy.[1] He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was president of the Oxford Union, and thereafter at the University of Edinburgh, earning a Bachelor of Laws degree.[1]
Political career[edit]
Douglas-Hamilton served as an advocate and an interim Procurator Fiscal Depute from 1968 to 1972.[1] From 1972 to 1974, he was a councillor on Edinburgh District Council, and after unsuccessfully contesting Hamilton in February 1974, from October 1974 to 1997 he was Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West. During this time he served in the Scottish Office.[1] He was briefly Falkland Pursuivant in the Court of the Lord Lyon in July 1973.[2]In the years between 1987 and 1995 he served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, and thereafter as Minister of State between 1995 and 1997. He had previously been a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury between 1979 and 1981. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor and Queen's Counsel in 1996.[1]It was announced on 12 December 2011[3] that he would serve as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, who is the Sovereign's personal representative to the Annual General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in 2012.[1]
Peerage[edit]
In 1994 on the death of George Nigel Douglas-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Selkirk, Selkirk inherited the earldom, although the succession was disputed, as Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, a nephew of the 10th Earl, claimed it, ultimately without success.[1] Due to the terms of the Peerage Act 1963, Selkirk was considered to be unable to vote in the House of Commons until he had disclaimed the title, even though the succession to it had not been decided. As the Conservative government of the day had a small majority, he felt obliged to disclaim immediately.[1]After losing his seat in the 1997 general election, he was elevated to the House of Lords as a life peer, being created Baron Selkirk of Douglas, of Cramond in the City of Edinburgh council area.[4] Lord Selkirk retired from the House of Lords on 27 July 2023.[5]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
From 1999 to 2007 he was a member of the Scottish Parliament and was deputy Convener of its Education Committee. In November 2005, Lord Selkirk of Douglas announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2003–2007 session of the Scottish Parliament. He continued to sit in the House of Lords, taking a particular interest in British legislation as it affects Scotland.[6]
Books[edit]
Lord Selkirk of Douglas wrote a number of books, including  Motive For a Mission: The Story Behind Hess's Flight to Britain about his father's meeting with Rudolf Hess when he landed in Scotland during World War II. He later wrote a biography on Rudolf Hess entitled The Truth About Rudolf Hess (1993).[1]
Personal life[edit]
On 24 August 1974 Douglas-Hamilton married Priscilla Susan Buchan, daughter of John Buchan, 2nd Baron Tweedsmuir, and Priscilla Jean Fortescue Thomson, and granddaughter of the politician and novelist John Buchan. They had four sons:[1][7]
John Andrew Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Earl of Selkirk (b. 1978)
Charles Douglas Douglas Hamilton (b. 1979)
James Robert Douglas-Hamilton (b. 1981)
Harry Alexander Douglas-Hamilton (b. 1981)Douglas-Hamilton was fifth in line to the Dukedom of Hamilton, after the sons and the brother of the 16th Duke.
He died of pneumonia on 28 November 2023, at the age of 81.[7][8]

He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region between 2016 and 2021, having previously been MSP for Rutherglen (formerly Glasgow Rutherglen) from 2007 to 2016.
Kelly has held a number of Scottish Labour frontbench posts including Finance Spokesperson and Justice Spokesperson under Richard Leonard from 2017 to 2020. He served as the Scottish Labour Party's Parliamentary Business Manager at Holyrood as well as Spokesperson for Community Safety and Drugs Policy.

Early life and career[edit]
Kelly grew up in the Halfway area of Cambuslang, and was educated at the co-educational, Roman Catholic Trinity High School, Rutherglen.[1] He studied at Glasgow College of Technology and went on to work in computing and finance. A chartered accountant, he worked as a business analyst in East Kilbride.[2] He served as the election agent for the former Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP Tommy McAvoy at the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections. He was also chair of the Rutherglen and Hamilton West Constituency Labour Party.[3]
Political career[edit]
Kelly was elected as MSP for Rutherglen in 2007 Scottish Parliament election.[4] Upon entering the Scottish Parliament, he served on the Finance Committee and as a Labour Whip.[5] From 2008 to 2011, he was a member of the Justice Committee and Shadow Minister for Community Safety.[6]
Kelly in 2011Kelly was re-elected at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.[7] Following the election of Johann Lamont as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in the 2011 leadership election, he was appointed Chief Whip in Holyrood. He was subsequently made Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities in a reshuffle in June 2013.[8]After the election of Jim Murphy as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Kelly was appointed to succeed Paul Martin as Labour's Parliamentary Business Manager.[9]Under Kezia Dugdale's leadership, he remained parliamentary business manager.[10] In December 2014, he was named as the party's election coordinator for the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[11][12]In December 2015, Kelly was ejected from the parliamentary debating chamber by presiding officer Tricia Marwick when he refused to sit down after attempting to make a point of order during a trade union bill debate.[13][14]Kelly sought selection for the Glasgow regional list prior to the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[15] While Kelly lost his Holyrood constituency seat to the SNP's Clare Haughey in 2016, he was elected as a list MSP for the Glasgow region.[16][17][18] Haughey's majority of 3,743 made it a target seat for Labour in the future. The equivalent Westminster seat Rutherglen and Hamilton West was won back by Labour's Gerard Killen in the 2017 UK general election, despite being one of the biggest swings towards the SNP two years prior.[19][20] He was the party's campaign manager for the 2017 general election.[21]When Kezia Dugdale resigned as Scottish Labour leader, Kelly's name was touted as a potential successor.[3] In December 2017, Richard Leonard appointed Kelly as his Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution.[22][23] In October 2018, following a reshuffle of the Scottish Labour frontbench in Holyrood, Kelly continued to hold the finance portfolio while Neil Findlay took forward the constitutional brief.[24]He was reselected in September 2019 as the Scottish Labour and Co-operative candidate for Rutherglen constituency at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.
He served as the Convener of the Cross-Party Group in the Scottish Parliament on Co-operatives and was the deputy Convener of the Cross-Party Group on Sport.

Repeal of the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act[edit]
Following his re-election to the Scottish Parliament in May 2016, Kelly took forward his pledge to lead a member's bill to repeal the Offensive Behaviour at Football 2012 Act.[25] He described the 2012 legislation as having ""completely failed to tackle sectarianism"" and as ""illiberal"" which ""unfairly targets football fans"", ""condemned by legal experts, human rights organisations and equality groups"".[26][27]On 25 January 2018, MSPs voted by 65 to 61 in favour of the general principles of Kelly's Bill in the first stage of Holyrood's legislative process. It marked the first binding defeat in Parliament for the SNP Minority Government.[28] On 15 March, the vote to repeal the Act was passed with 62 in favour and 60 against.[29]
On 31 March 2019, violent incidents occurred during and after the Old Firm (Celtic vs Rangers) derbyPersonally I believe the repeal of the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act has had an impact, because I think that some people feel wrongly legitimised to behave in a way that they wouldn’t otherwise behave.[31][32]
Justice Spokesperson[edit]
In September 2019, Kelly was appointed as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Justice.[33] He resigned from this role in September 2020 while calling for Richard Leonard's resignation as Scottish Labour leader. In his resignation letter, seen by the Daily Record, James Kelly told Richard Leonard: “I have no confidence in your ability to shape the party's message, strategy and organisation. I know that this is a view shared by other parliamentarians, party members and indeed many members of the public.”[34]
Return to frontbench[edit]
Kelly nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[35] Following Sarwar's election as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, he was re-appointed as Parliamentary Business Manager as well as spokesperson for Community Safety and Drugs Policy ahead of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[36] In the election he lost out to Clare Haughey in the constituency, and though four Labour candidates were elected on the regional vote, Kelly had been fifth on the party list so was not returned as an MSP.[37]
Personal life[edit]
Kelly currently lives in Cambuslang with his wife, Alexa, and their two daughters.[38] He has spoken about his interests in sport, namely football, tennis and running.[39]

Whilst a student, Hepburn ran the unsuccessful campaign for Alasdair Gray to become the Rector of the University of Glasgow and was the Senior Vice-President at the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council, a post once held by his SNP Parliamentary colleague Alasdair Allan.

Career[edit]
Before his election, Hepburn was convener of the Federation of Student Nationalists and the Young Scots for Independence. He had been the SNP candidate for the Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East constituency at the 2005 general election.  He has worked for Alex Neil, a fellow SNP MSP.
Hepburn was elected during the 2007 election for the Central Scotland region, having also contested the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth seat at that election, finishing second behind Cathie Craigie.  In this election he was one of only two candidates to win more than 40% in the constituency contested and not win the seat, the other being Alasdair Morrison in the Western Isles. He was the second youngest elected member of the Scottish Parliament for the 2007–2011 session after his SNP colleague Aileen Campbell.
Hepburn was a member of the Scottish Parliament Rural Affairs and Environment Committee and a substitute member of the Equal Opportunities Committee until 26 June 2008 when he became a member of the European and External Relations Committee, and a substitute to the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee, before being switched to a substitute member of the Public Petitions Committee.  He subsequently was moved to the Public Audit and Equal Opportunities Committees towards the latter part of the third session of the Scottish Parliament.  He is now the Deputy Convener of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee.  Hepburn also served as the convener of the Cross Party Group on Human Rights and Civil Liberties in the Scottish Parliament's third session.
He was placed third on the SNP list for Central Scotland for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election[1] but was returned for the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth constituency. On 21 November 2014, it was announced that he would be Minister for Sport and Health Improvement.[2] On 18 May he was moved to the post of Minister for Employability and Training.
It was Hepburn's written question which revealed that projects in Scotland funded by the Private Finance Initiative will cost the taxpayer some £22.3 billion over a 40-year period.
He was one of six SNP MSPs to attend the ""Big Blockade"" event at the Faslane naval base organised by Faslane 365 on 1 October 2007[3] and has been active in calling for greater transparency about allegations that American government agencies facilitated extraordinary rendition flights through Scottish airports.[4][5]  He has also called for any Scottish airport that is being sold by BAA Limited to be brought under public control.[6]Hepburn has signed up to the People's Charter, a campaigning document prepared by trade unionists as an alternative to neoliberalism[7] and has drawn criticism from some elements of the Scottish media for having tabled a motion on Venezuela.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Hepburn's wife Julie was the SNP candidate for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East at the 2010 UK general election, she finished in second place to Labour with 9,794 votes. He is a supporter of Partick Thistle Football Club and lives in Cumbernauld.

Personal detailsBornJames Angus Rhoderick McGrigor (1949-10-19) 19 October 1949 (age 74)London, EnglandPolitical partyScottish Conservative PartyAlma materUniversity of NeuchâtelSir James Angus Rhoderick Neil McGrigor, 6th Baronet (born 19 October 1949) is a Scottish Conservative Party politician, who is a councillor in Argyll and Bute. He had previously been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Highlands and Islands region from 1999 until 2016.

Early life and career[edit]
McGrigor was born in London in 1949 and educated at Cladich Primary School in Argyll and privately at Eton College. He studied Commercial French at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. After graduating, he worked in finance in the City of London and in the shipping sector in Glasgow. He also farmed sheep and cattle, and started a trout farm in Argyll in the early 1970s.[1]
Political career[edit]
McGrigor stood unsuccessfully for the Western Isles in the 1997 general election. He fought Argyll and Bute in 2005, finishing second,[2] and fought the equivalent seat in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, finishing third.[3]He served as Scottish Conservative spokesperson for fisheries, and communities and sport. He is also an Honorary Vice-President of English-Speaking Union Scotland.
McGrigor was also the driving force behind the establishment of the Scottish Register of Tartans. His Member's Bill was given support by the Scottish Government and was subsequently passed by the Scottish Parliament on 9 October 2008. This makes McGrigor one of the first MSPs to have passed a Private Member's Bill through the Scottish Parliament.
In 2017, he stood in the Argyll and Bute Council election and was elected to the Oban South and the Isles ward.[4]
Family[edit]
McGrigor is the eldest son of the late Sir Charles McGrigor, 5th Bt, by his wife Mary Bettine (the historian Mary McGrigor),[5] daughter of Sir Charles Edmonstone, 6th Baronet. He is descended patrilineally from Sir James McGrigor, 1st Baronet, Wellington's Surgeon General serving the British Army in Spain during the Peninsular campaign, who received a baronetcy in 1831. Another distinguished relative was the late Admiral of the Fleet Sir Rhoderick McGrigor, grandson of the second Baronet and thus his first cousin twice removed.
Jamie became the 6th Baronet upon the death of his father, Sir Charles, on 1 October 2007.[6]He has been twice married and has six children.[1] His son Alexander James Edward Lyon (born 1998), by his second marriage, is his heir apparent.[7]

She was later offered an OBE but turned it down.[20] In 2015, it was reported that she had decided to hand back her MBE, explaining that the awards system did not recognise the efforts of the many other people that had been involved.[21]She received an honorary fellowship from the University of the Highlands and Islands in 2006.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Since 1973 she has managed ""The Ceilidh Place"",[13] a hotel in Ullapool which was named Venue of the Year at the Scots Trad awards in December 2014 for its championing of Scottish culture all year round.[23] She was married to Robert Urquhart, a well-known Scottish actor in British film, stage and television, who died in 1995.
In 2000 she took a Scottish Studies course at Newbattle Abbey College.[24] In 2017 she completed an art course and some of her work was exhibited in Ullapool following this.[25]

Personal detailsBornJeane Tennent Freeman (1953-09-28) 28 September 1953 (age 70)Ayr, South Ayrshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyOther politicalaffiliationsCommunist Party of Great Britain Labour PartyAlma materGlasgow College of TechnologyWebsiteParliamentary websiteJeane Tennent Freeman OBE (born 28 September 1953)[1][2] is a Scottish retired businesswoman and politician who served as Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport from 2018 to 2021.[3] A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency from 2016 to 2021.
Born into a Labour-supporting, working-class family in South Ayrshire, Freeman attended the Glasgow College of Technology, studying sociology and politics.[4][5][6] She became politically active at an early age and was a member of the  Communist Party's student wing, before joining the Labour Party.[7] In 1987, she established Apex Scotland, a criminal justice employment organisation, for which she served as CEO until 2000.[8] Freeman later served as a political advisor to the Labour First Minister Jack McConnell from 2001 to 2005.[9] In the run up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, she and several other women, founded the Women for Independence.[10] Freeman campaigned in support for Scottish independence and in the aftermath of the Yes Scotland campaign's defeat in the referendum, she joined the Scottish National Party.[11]The following year Freeman was selected as the SNP's candidate for the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[12][13] She was elected to the 5th Scottish Parliament and was subsequently appointed a junior ministerial post as Minister for Social Security. In this role, she worked alongside the Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities to establish Social Security Scotland, which claims as her ""greatest achievement"".[14] Following a 2018 cabinet reshuffle of the Second Sturgeon government, Freeman was promoted to the Scottish Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport. During Freeman's tenure as the Scottish Health Secretary, she played a vital role to Scotland's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[15] She led press briefings to the public, was criticised for handling of care homes and announced Scotland's preparation plan for delivering COVID-19 vaccines.[16] In 2020, she announced her intention to step down as an MSP, therefore relinquishing her role as Health Secretary.[17]
Early life[edit]
Jeane Tennent Freeman was born on 28 September 1953 in Ayr.[1][2] Freeman was raised in South Ayrshire with her two brothers, to a trade union, Labour supporting family.[4] Her mother was an nurse and her father, son of an immigrant family, was an aircraft fitter and was in the RAF during WWII.[12][18] After coming back from war, he was determined to create social justice, something that Freeman aspired to continue from her father.[18][5]Freeman was educated at Ayr Academy and from 1975 to 1979, she attended the Glasgow College of Technology, studying sociology and politics.[6][19] Freeman also trained to be a nurse and went on to earn a degree.[5][4][20]Freeman was a leading member of the Communist Party's student wing and in 1979 she became the first woman to chair the National Union of Students Scotland.[7] In 1983 Freeman was a member of the Communist party's Congress Arrangements Committee which oversaw the running of that year's party congress.[21]
Early career[edit]
In 1987, Freeman established Apex Scotland, a criminal justice employment organisation for which she served as Chief Executive for twelve years. She was appointed as a member of the Parole Board for Scotland in 2006[22] and has also played roles on the Scottish Police Services Authority Board. She was appointed as a Lay Member to the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland, commencing November 2011 for a four-year period.[8]In 2008 she was appointed to the board of the National Waiting Times Centre, the special health board that runs the Golden Jubilee National Hospital.[23] In January 2015 she was reappointed as the Chair to the National Waiting Times Centre Board.[24] In March 2016 she stepped down from this role.[25]In the 2013/14 financial year Freeman worked for a number of bodies, including Police Scotland, the NHS National Waiting Time Centre and the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland.[26] She billed taxpayers for 376 days work - leading her to be dubbed 'the Quango Queen' in the press.[26][27] A spokesman for Freeman said, ""A contracted day does not mean sitting in an office – indeed, many boards meet during the evening. It is entirely routine for members of public boards to have a number of other interests.""[26]
Early political career[edit]
Senior political advisor[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2016Later Freeman joined the Scottish Labour Party and was a member until the late 1990s.[28] Between 2001 and 2005, Freeman served as a senior political adviser to First Minister Jack McConnell.[9] In this role, she worked on the Scottish Budget, the government's legislative programme, relations with the UK government, and in the Finance, Health and Justice portfolios.[8] She left the position voluntarily, though there were reports of a row between Freeman and John Elvidge, which were dismissed by the Scottish Executive.[29] Months after she left, the Scottish Executive hired her consultancy firm, Freeman Associates, in a consultancy capacity, generating accusations of cronyism.[30]2014 Scottish independence referendum[edit]
As a member of Scottish Labour, Freeman had never supported Scottish independence. Her experience of working in the Scottish Executive, became an option ""worth considering"".[4] Freeman was active in the campaign for Scottish independence since the announcement of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.[9] In May 2012 it was announced that she was a part of Yes Scotland. She is a founding member of Women for Independence[31][32] and spoke at a meeting of the Labour for Independence group.[32][33] During the referendum campaign she made appearances on television programmes as a commentator.[10]
Member of the Scottish Parliament; 2016 to 2021[edit]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
Freeman played a role in setting up Social Security Scotland as a junior minister.In November 2014, when the SNP voted in favour of allowing non-members to stand as their candidates in the general elections, Nicola Sturgeon named Freeman as an example of the sort of person that might be chosen by a constituency branch.[11] In August 2015, Freeman was selected to be the SNP candidate for the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency in the 2016 Scottish elections.[12]In April 2016, former Labour politician Brian Wilson covered the topic of Freedom of information (FOI) requests in his column in The Scotsman, observing that her company Freeman Associates had recently been the subject of a request to the Scottish Government.[34] The Ministers had responded to the applicant that the cost of replying to this specific request would exceed £600 and they were therefore not obliged to comply.[13] Following a review, the applicant remained dissatisfied and applied to the Information Commissioner for a decision.[13]Freeman was elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.

Junior minister[edit]
In May 2016, she was appointed a junior minister post in the Second Sturgeon government as Minister for Social Security. As the inaugural holder, she worked alongside Angela Constance, the Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, to help establish Social Security Scotland, with Scotland's new social security powers from Westminster. Freeman stated: “It was a real privilege to help lay the foundations for a social security service, and I use the word service because we are about dignity and respect and I was immensely proud to do that.” [14]
Scottish Health Secretary (2018–2021)[edit]
In a cabinet reshuffle by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she was appointed Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport on 26 June 2018. As Health Secretary she played a big part in the Scottish Government's response to the covid-19 pandemic.

Glasgow hospital infection crisis[edit]
In 2019, Freeman faced calls for her resignation following ten cases of infections linked to water contamination at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde later reported two deaths of children, who had been linked to infection from the hospital. When asked if she would resign on an interview with the BBC, she stated: ""No I'm not because my focus is on fixing these matters and restoring public confidence. That's the right thing for me to do.""

Death threat[edit]
In February 2020, Freeman was forced up her security presence amid death threats against her. The threats were in relation to the Glasgow hospital infection crisis and  Police Scotland had charged a man. She told Holyrood Magazine: “I think the threats are a symptom of this notion that I am personally responsible for everything that happens. I cannot be personally responsible, but I am accountable for how well our health service performs and how well I act to resolve those areas where it’s not doing as it should do.""[35]
COVID-19 pandemic response[edit]
Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland
Freeman leading a Scottish Government press conference on Coronavirus.Freeman served as Health Secretary during the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland and briefed the public in press conferences.[16] In April 2020, she said in a statement in the Scottish Parliament a network of COVID-19 local assessment centres was to be set up across Scotland with 50 planned in the first wave.[36][37][38][39] A network of ""humanitarian assistance centres"" were also set up, working with GPs and other local partners to arrange delivery of medicine, care services and grocery delivery.[40]
COVID-19 vaccination programme[edit]
In November 2020, Freeman delivered a statement to the Scottish Parliament on vaccines. She announced that Scotland was ready to administer the first vaccine for COVID-19 in the first week in February, if the vaccine is given safety clearance.[41] Freeman also announced the priorities list for the first wave of vaccinations, which ran from December to February 2021. The priorities are: “frontline health and social care staff, older residents in care homes, care home staff, all those aged 80 and over, unpaid carers and personal assistants & those delivering the vaccination.”[42]
Care home deaths[edit]
During the pandemic, 1,300 elderly patients were transferred into care homes without receiving a negative coronavirus test result.[43] Many had the disease and ended up passing the virus onto other care home residents.[44] Over three thousand care home residents died from coronavirus;[45] in some care homes dozens of pensioners died - contributing significantly to Scotland recording one of the highest death tolls in Europe.[44] Gary Smith, Scotland secretary of the GMB, said the policy turned “care homes into morgues”[45] and in March 2021 Freeman admitted to the BBC: ""We [the Scottish Government] didn’t take the right precautions to make sure that older people leaving hospital going into care homes were as safe as they could be and that was a mistake.""[44][43] After leaving office Freeman said that the characterisation of the policy as a ""death sentence"" for the elderly had hurt her personally and that the criticism from opposition parties was ""not fair"".[46]On 24 August 2020, Freeman confirmed that she would not be standing at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[47]
Awards and honours[edit]
In the 1996 Birthday Honours, she was awarded an OBE for her services to the rehabilitation of offenders.[48]

Personal detailsBornNovember 1968 (age 55)[1] cElgin, Scotland[2]Political partyScottish National PartyJennifer Margot Minto (born 1968) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Argyll and Bute since 2021.[3] She has been serving as Minister for Public Health and Women's Health since March 2023.[4]
Career[edit]
Minto was educated at Madras College in St. Andrews,[5] and graduated with an MA in accountancy from the University of Aberdeen in 1989.[6] She qualified as a chartered accountant in 1992.[6]Prior to being elected as an MSP, she worked at accountancy firm KPMG, and in accounts at BBC Scotland in Glasgow.[6] She later settled on the Isle of Islay, with management roles at the Islay Energy Trust and the Museum of Islay Life.[2]Minto was elected as her party's candidate for the election by local SNP members in November 2020,[7] and entered parliament on 8 May 2021.[8]From 17 June 2021 - 1 Feb 2023, she sat on the Rural Affairs Islands and Natural Environment Committee.[9]As of 2022, she sits on the Constitution, Europe, External Affairs and Culture Committee, the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee, and the Rural Affairs and Islands Committee, as well as 15 cross-party groups including the Cross-Party Group in the Scottish Parliament on Creative Economy and Cross-Party Group in the Scottish Parliament on Tourism.[9]In 2023, she was appointed to the Yousaf government as Minister for Public Health and Women's Health.[10]
Caledonian MacBrayne ferry delay[edit]
In the late 2010s, Scottish islanders began to complain that the ageing ferry fleet that connected them to the mainland had become increasingly unreliable.[11][12][13][14] During the winter of 2022 only one in three sailings to the island of Coll went ahead;[15] Hebridean shopkeepers kept receiving deliveries of rotten food;[16][17]
while other islanders said they had missed doctors’ appointments, funerals and even the chance to say goodbye to dying loved ones because of cancelled sailings.[18][19][20]In June 2022, Minto raised the issue in the Scottish Parliament; ""I was impacted by a ferry breakdown on Monday, but thanks to the excellent CalMac staff, I and other ferry users were able to get on later ferries. Does the First Minister agree that the staff of CalMac work tirelessly to help all their customers when breakdowns happen?"" Nicola Sturgeon agreed and said, ""The CalMac staff do an excellent job, often in really difficult circumstances, so I want to recognise and acknowledge that"".[21]

Personal detailsBornJennifer Madeleine Gilruth1984 (age 39–40)Aberdeen, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySpouseKezia Dugdale ​(m. 2022)​Alma materUniversity of GlasgowUniversity of StrathclydeWebsitewww.jennygilruthmsp.scotJennifer Madeleine Gilruth (born 1984) is a Scottish politician who is serving as the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills since 2023. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Mid Fife and Glenrothes since 2016.[1]A native of Aberdeenshire, Gilruth studied in Glasgow at the University of Glasgow and later the University of Strathclyde. After graduating she went on to work as modern studies teacher in Edinburgh, before later becoming the principal teacher of social subjects at St. Columba's RC High School in Dunfermline. Gilruth marked exams for the SQA and served as the national qualifications development officer at Education Scotland.  
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Gilruth was elected as a member of the Scottish Parliament for the Mid Fife and Glenrothes constituency. She sat on the SNP's backbenches and served successively in the parliament's education, health, justice and social security committees. On 17 February 2020, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appointed Gilruth to the Scottish Government as the minister for culture, Europe and international development. She was later reshuffled as the transport minister and oversaw the transition of the public ownership of ScotRail. Following Humza Yousaf's appointment as first minister of Scotland, a campaign Gilruth endorsed, she was subsequently appointed to cabinet as the education secretary.

Early life and career[edit]
Gilruth was first raised in Banff, Aberdeenshire, before her family moved to Ceres, Fife.[2] Her father was born and raised in Newport-on-Tay.[3] She was educated at Madras College (St Andrews, Fife)[4] and lives in Markinch. She graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in sociology and politics, and obtained her Professional Graduate Diploma in Education from the University of Strathclyde.[4][2]Before becoming an MSP, Gilruth was a Principal Teacher of Social Subjects at St. Columba's Roman Catholic High School, Dunfermline, she was previously a National Qualifications Development Officer at Education Scotland, and prior to that taught Modern Studies at the Royal High School, in Edinburgh.[5] Gilruth also marked exams for the Scottish Qualifications Authority and is a published author.[6]
Political career[edit]
Backbencher (2016-2020)[edit]
In April 2016, Gilruth was nominated as the SNP’s candidate for Mid Fife and Glenrothes in the Scottish Parliament election on 5 May 2016.[7] She won the seat with 15,555 votes (54.9% of the vote), with a majority of 8,236; more than double the votes cast for second-place candidate Kay Morrison of Scottish Labour.[8] She succeeded Tricia Marwick, who had been the Presiding Officer in the 4th Scottish Parliament (2011–16).[9]
Junior minister (2020-2023)[edit]
In February 2020, Gilruth joined the Scottish Government as Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development as part of the reshuffle following the resignation of Cabinet Secretary for Finance Derek Mackay.[10]In a ministerial reshuffle on 24 January 2022, Gilruth was appointed as Minister for Transport, following the resignation of Graeme Dey.[11][12] She said: ""The transport portfolio is an exciting opportunity to not just shape the infrastructure of our country but to also help Scotland become a world leader in achieving our goal to become net zero by 2045.""[11][12] Since becoming Transport Minister, she has been involved in managing issues related to ScotRail train services and a dispute with ASLEF, as well as responsibilities relating to the provision of Scottish ferries.[2][13] In June 2022, she responded to questions in the Scottish Parliament about her accountability and responsibility in resolving the ScotRail/ASLEF pay dispute.[2][13]
Education Secretary (2023-present)[edit]
See also: Premiership of Humza Yousaf
On 29 March 2023, newly appointed First Minister Humza Yousaf promoted Gilruth to the Scottish Cabinet as the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, succeeding Shirley-Anne Somerville.[14][15]
Personal life[edit]
On 15 July 2017, it was announced Gilruth was in a relationship with Kezia Dugdale, who was, at that time, Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.[16] In June 2022, Gilruth and Dugdale married in a private ceremony.[17]

She attended St John's High School in Dundee before going on to study history at  the University of St Andrews, graduating in 1999 with an MA in modern history.[1]She won a scholarship to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, after which she returned to her home town and spent five years promoting Dundee as a location for students, research and investment as Head of Press at the University of Dundee.[2] In 2008, she graduated from the University of Glasgow with an LLB, and in 2009 received a graduate diploma in law from BPP University in London. In 2010, she graduated with a Diploma in Legal Practice from the University of Dundee.[1]
Political career[edit]
After a stint as the Labour MEPs spokesperson in Brussels and Strasbourg, Marra took a Scots law degree and qualified in both Scots and English law and Scottish legal practice. She is member of the GMB, Community and Amnesty International.[3] She was Labour's Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Sport from 2014 until 2016.[4] In addition to her party posts, Marra was also the Convenor for the Cross Party Group on Deafness.[4]In the 2014 Scottish Labour Party leadership election, Marra acted as co-chair of Jim Murphy’s campaign.[5]At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Marra stood for Dundee City West constituency and finished behind Joe Fitzpatrick, then she was returned to parliament as a list MSP.[6] She is currently the Convener of the Scottish Committee for Public Audit and Post-legislative Scrutiny.[7][8]Marra argued that the Labour Party should attempt to block Brexit in the House of Commons.[8]In November 2019, it was announced that Marra and Scottish National Party MSP Joan McAlpine would be hosting an event on behalf of the ""Women's Human Rights Campaign"", an international campaign that launched in New York in March 2019. The campaign's self-declared focus is on ""the importance of keeping the current sex based definition of woman"". The announcement was met with criticism from some feminist and LGBT groups, including Engender, The Equality Network and the Scottish Trans Alliance, who expressed their concerns that the Campaign's aims would breach Human Rights law, and in particular the rights of transgender people. However, a spokeswoman for the Campaign reiterated that their aim was to ""re-affirm women’s sex-based rights, as set out in international human rights documents"".[9]In September 2020, Marra became the first Labour MSP to call for Richard Leonard to quit as Scottish Labour leader. She said ""If we do not change course now we risk catastrophe. The reality is that you only have a short window in political leadership to make an impression on the public. After three years the party’s standing is getting worse rather than better. No one can say that Richard has not had opportunities to turn the situation around. Richard’s leadership was tied from the start to the disaster of Jeremy Corbyn's project. It remains so in the public's view and they simply will not give the party a hearing as things stand.""[10]On 28 November 2020, Marra announced that she would not stand in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, stating ""I have decided that my role as an MSP takes me away from my young children during the week in Edinburgh but also at evening meetings and weekend commitments"".[11]Marra nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Marra is a niece of musician Michael Marra.[13] Her brother is Michael Marra, who replaced his sister as Labour MSP for North East Scotland in 2021.
In May 2016, Marra married John Thomson of the newspaper group DC Thomson;[citation needed] they have two children.[8][11]

Personal detailsBorn (1967-03-11) 11 March 1967 (age 56)Edinburgh, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesAlma materUniversity of EdinburghLondon Bible CollegeJeremy Ross Balfour (born 11 March 1967) is a Scottish Conservative politician who has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothian region since 2016.
A solicitor and Baptist Minister, he was first elected in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.

Early life and career[edit]
Balfour was born in Edinburgh in 1967, the third of four children of Ian and Joyce Balfour.
Balfour attended the independent Edinburgh Academy and has spoken about the impact of his disability on his childhood. In 2005 Balfour praised his parents and teachers saying that they got the correct balance ""between pushing me to do things and when I could not, finding other ways of getting me involved. For example I could not play rugby but I was made touch judge"".[1]Balfour came from a family which included several lawyers and decided to pursue a legal career so then studied at the University of Edinburgh. He trained as a solicitor. After working as a solicitor, he studied at London Bible College to become a Baptist minister in 1995 and subsequently worked as an assistant minister at Morningside Baptist Church, where he met his wife. Around this time Balfour also worked as a lobbyist for the Evangelical Alliance.[1]
Political career[edit]
Electoral Politics[edit]
Balfour previously stood in Edinburgh East and Musselburgh in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election and Central Fife in the 2001 UK General Election.
Balfour was elected to City of Edinburgh Council, representing the Corstorphine/Murrayfield ward from 2007 and did not stand for re-election in 2017 after being elected to Holyrood.
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Balfour stood for the Scottish Parliament as the Conservative candidate for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, where he came third.[2] He was instead elected from the Lothian regional list.[3]
Parliamentary career[edit]
Shortly after being elected, Balfour became Scottish Conservative spokesperson for childcare and early years and joined the Equal Opportunities Committee of the Scottish Parliament.[4][5]Throughout his time in office, Balfour has consistently raised issues relating to disabled people. In 2021, Balfour was the Scottish Conservative Deputy Party Spokesperson on Equalities and Deputy Party Spokesperson on Older People.[6]In 2018, Balfour came under pressure to resign as the Scottish Conservative's welfare spokesperson for suggesting that terminally-ill people who don't die within three years should be re-assessed for benefits. He refused to apologise for the remarks, but was forced to withdraw the amendment to the Social Security (Scotland) Bill.[7]Balfour was awarded 'Speech of the Year' by Holyrood Magazine in June 2019 for a speech on the 70th anniversary of the NHS.[8]November 2020 was the 25th anniversary of the Disability Discrimination Act coming into law. Balfour stated his opinion that more needs to be done to help disabled people into work in society.[9]Balfour is the convenor of the Cross-Party Group in the Scottish Parliament on Disability, and co-convenor of the Cross-Party Group in the Scottish Parliament on Funerals and Bereavement. Balfour is also the member of many other cross-party groups entering on sport, disability, education and on matters relating to equality.[6]On 12 January 2022, Balfour called for Boris Johnson to resign as Conservative party leader and Prime Minister over the Westminster lockdown parties controversy along with a majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs.[10]
Political views[edit]
In his role for the Evangelical Alliance, Balfour called in 2000 for ""an alternative [in schools] where children could play and explore the imagination"" in instances where Christian parents were concerned of their children having to celebrate Halloween.[11] Balfour said of this role when talking about its stance on gay marriage in 2005, saying ""My role with the Evangelical Alliance is to put across the Christian perspective. It does not mean that I feel people with different lifestyles should be discriminated against.""[1]The Evangelical Alliance is openly opposed to ""all attitudes and actions which victimise or diminish"" people with same-sex attraction, but believes that marriage between one man and one woman ""is the only form of partnership approved by God for sexual relations"" and so does not accept ""sexually active same-sex partnerships as a legitimate form of Christian relationship.""[12]From 2004 to 2014, Balfour was director of the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics, a right-wing think tank. In keeping with his aforementioned views on discrimination, Balfour distanced himself from the think-tank after it emerged it had produced a report questioning the morality of victims of rape who take the morning-after pill.[13]In the aforementioned interview in 2005, Balfour said ""Marriage is for a man and a woman. That would be the Bible's perspective. But we have to recognise there are different views in society.""[1] Balfour has been consistent in his view on this and has stated his acceptance of the legality of same-sex marriage within Scotland in the legal sense.[14]Balfour has expressed concern and raised parliamentary questions regarding abortion. Specifically, Balfour is concerned about abortions in cases of disabilities. He expressed fears in 2018 around whether or not women who were potentially going to give birth to disabled children were getting access to all the information and support that they need to make informed decisions. Balfour expressed these fears in relation to limb disabilities like his own and also to Down Syndrome.[15] In the interview, Balfour said ""As a society we have to say ultimately it is the mother's choice, but the mother needs to be given as much information as possible to help with an understanding that yes, a disabled child will bring with it other issues, but it will also perhaps give you extra opportunities that you would not have expected.""[15]Reflecting on his own birth, he said: ""It was a time where lots of individuals were born with lots of different disabilities for different reasons, and there was a special centre built here in Edinburgh, the Princess Margaret Rose orthopaedic hospital. There were lots of us around who either had upper or lower limb operations and fifty years on from that I happened to be asking staff how many people born more recently with a similar disability do they treat? The response came that in regard to children, there is now a very small number – under ten – that they have had in the last number of years coming in. The reason for that is two-fold; one is a positive reason where I think mums are living healthier lifestyles and I think that has definitely affected the number of children born with a disability.The second reason is that children who come up on a scan with a disability, too often I think, mothers think 'we need to abort this child'. Now that clearly is a mother's choice and whether or not they make that choice is not for me to comment on. But for me, I wonder whether mums are being given the whole picture; for example, yes having a child with a disability such as an upper limb missing doesn't mean they can't still go on to do lots of things. They can still go through education and lead a very fulfilling life.""[15]
Personal life[edit]
Balfour has a physical disability which left him with no left arm and a right arm that ends at the elbow from which two elongated fingers protrude.[1][16][17] In relation to his disability, Balfour has said that thalidomide is not the cause of his disability and it is uncertain what in fact is.[1]In 2019, Balfour and a dog that his family looks after, Sadie, won the Holyrood Dog of the Year competition having taken part in an assault course.[18]Balfour is married with two daughters.[19]

Personal detailsBorn (1974-01-15) 15 January 1974 (age 50)Berwick-upon-Tweed, EnglandPolitical partyScottish Liberal DemocratsWebsite[1]Jeremy Purvis, Baron Purvis of Tweed (born 15 January 1974) is a Scottish Liberal Democrat politician.  He was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale from 2003 to 2011. In  August 2013 it was announced that he would be elevated to the House of Lords.[1]He is the leader of the Devo Plus cross-party group.

Background[edit]
He was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed, England, where he later attended school. He studied Politics and Modern History at Brunel University in London, graduating in 1996.  While at university he worked for the ELDR (Liberal) Group in the European Parliament and Liberal International.

Career[edit]
On graduating, Purvis worked full-time for Sir David Steel in the House of Commons and then ran his office in the House of Lords. In 1998 he moved to Edinburgh to work for a parliamentary affairs company and in 2001 he established, with a fellow director, his own strategic communications consultancy, advising clients on communications.
He was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2003 aged 29, making him the youngest constituency MSP at the time. He was the Scottish Liberal Democrat Finance Spokesman and then moved on to become Justice and Home Affairs spokesman.  He was re-elected in 2007 following a close campaign, with some of the media stating that the Scottish National Party candidate Christine Grahame would defeat him.  Ultimately, both parties greatly increased their vote shares at the expense of the Conservatives and Labour. Purvis's margin declined by 0.2 percentage points but increased by 65 votes; this discrepancy was due to a vast increase in turnout in the 2007 election. He was subsequently defeated by Grahame in the 2011 election.
He was the Scottish Liberal Democrats Spokesman for the Economy and Finance. Mr Purvis wrote the Scottish Liberal Democrats 2011 Election Manifesto.  He currently lives in Galashiels.
He was created a life peer on 13 September 2013 taking the title Baron Purvis of Tweed, of East March in the Scottish Borders.[2]In November 2016 he was announced as a member of the Commission on Parliamentary Reform, having been nominated to represent the Scottish Liberal Democrats.[3]

Personal detailsBorn (1968-11-04) 4 November 1968 (age 55)Peebles, Scottish Borders, ScotlandAlma materUniversity of EdinburghJim Hume MBA FRSA ARAgS HonAssoc BVA is a former Scottish Liberal Democrat politician. He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) of the South of Scotland region from May 2007 to March 2016. He is currently Director of Public Affairs & Communications at Change Mental Health and Convenes the National Rural Mental Health Forum.[1]
Background[edit]
Hume was born in Peebles but raised in Selkirkshire. His previous positions include Chairman of ""Environment and Land Use"" for the National Farmers Union of Scotland and President of Lothians and Borders NFU. He was active during the Foot-and-mouth crisis of 2001. Hume was also chair of the Borders Foundation for Rural Sustainability and was on the board of Scottish Enterprise Borders, a member of the Forestry Commission's South of Scotland Regional Forum, a Trustee of The Borders Forest Trust and a founding Director of the South of Scotland Loan Fund Scheme.

Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Hume was elected to the Scottish Parliament to represent the South of Scotland region at the 2007 general election, making him the first Liberal Democrat MSP in the region since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999. He was also elected councillor of the Galashiels and District region of Scottish Borders Council on the same night. Hume was Scottish Liberal Democrat Spokesman for Housing and Health. He sat on the Scottish Parliament's Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment Committee, and was the committee's EU Reporter. He was also the Scottish Liberal Democrat Deputy Whip and a member of the European Committee of Regions.
In December 2014, Hume successfully introduced a Member's Bill in the Scottish Parliament, the Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Bill. It was enacted in January 2016 and protects 60,000 children every week from the dangers of second hand smoke in cars.[2] In the twelve months following his Bill, the number of children being exposed to second-hand smoke halved.
In October 2015, Hume called on Health Secretary Shona Robison to review support provided for gender identity clinics after new figures revealed that the average waiting time for a first appointment at two of Scotland's GICs was more than a year.[3]

Personal detailsBornJames Stuart Mather (1947-03-06) 6 March 1947 (age 76)Lochwinnoch, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materUniversity of GlasgowProfessionAccountantJames Stuart ""Jim"" Mather (born 6 March 1947) is a former Scottish National Party (SNP) politician.  He was the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism from 2007 to 2011, and he was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 2003 to 2011. He was the SNP's National Treasurer for four years and after leaving Parliament has held various non-executive posts and academic roles.

Early life[edit]
Mather was born in Lochwinnoch and was educated at Paisley Grammar School and Greenock High School before attending the University of Glasgow. Prior to his election to Holyrood he worked as a chartered accountant and ran his own business.[1]
Political career[edit]
He joined the SNP in 1996 and was the SNP's National Treasurer from 2000.
He is credited with making and presenting the economic case for Scottish Independence, having taken the argument to the media, boardrooms and committee rooms across Scotland between 2001 and 2007.
He was the SNP candidate in the 2000 Ayr by-election and was their candidate for Argyll and Bute at the 2003 election. That latter election saw him elected to the Scottish Parliament as a regional list member for the Highlands and Islands. In opposition he was the SNP's Shadow Enterprise and Economy Minister.
Mather contested Argyll and Bute again at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election and was successful, winning the seat from George Lyon of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.
After the SNP's victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, Mather was appointed Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism and held that post for 4 years until the end of the 2011 parliament.

After Parliament[edit]
Jim Mather stood down as an MSP at the 2011 election.[2]In 2014, he chaired the Scottish Government's Working Together Review, which was asked to produce a report with recommendations that would help create many more progressive and collegiate workplaces in Scotland. That report was well-received and contributed to the creation of a Cabinet role that covers Fair Work and a Fair Work Convention.
In December 2014 he was announced as chairman of the trade body Homes for Scotland, formally taking up the three-year part-time position in May 2015.[3] He stood down by mutual agreement on 12 May 2017.[4]Mather is currently[when?] a visiting professor with the University of Strathclyde and Heriot-Watt University and fulfils other consultancy and speaking roles.

Personal detailsBorn (1954-08-25) 25 August 1954 (age 69)Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, ScotlandPolitical partyLiberal DemocratsSpouseRosemary Fraser ​(m. 1983)​EducationAnnan Academy, DumfriesshireAlma materDowning College, CambridgeUniversity of EdinburghJames Robert Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness, PC, KC, FRSE (born 25 August 1954) is a Scottish politician serving as a Liberal Democrat life peer in the British House of Lords since 2007 and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 2021 to 2022. He served as the Deputy First Minister of Scotland from 1999 to 2005, and during that time he served twice as acting First Minister, in 2000, in the aftermath of Donald Dewar's death and in 2001, following Henry McLeish's resignation. He was formerly Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 1992 to 2005 and Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords from 2013 to 2016.
Wallace served as a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland from 1983 to 2001 and a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Orkney from 1999 to 2007. He also served as Advocate General for Scotland from 2010 to 2015. He was the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1 May 2021 to 23 May 2022.[1]
Early life and education[edit]
Wallace was born in Annan in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, and grew up there. He has a brother, Neil. As a boy, his first interest in politics was stoked when he collected autographs from politicians visiting the local area:[2] he still possesses one from Tam Dalyell, with whom he later served in the House of Commons.
Wallace was educated at Annan Academy, a state secondary school in his hometown of Annan. Following school, he was accepted by Downing College, Cambridge, where he obtained a joint BA degree in economics and law. From there he returned to Scotland to study law at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an LLB degree in 1977.[3] Based in Edinburgh, he practised as an advocate at the Scottish Bar, mostly in civil law cases.[3]

Wallace joined the then-Liberal Party in the early 1970s, but did not become very active in it until after completing his second degree. His first foray as a parliamentary candidate was in the constituency of Dumfriesshire in 1979, where he failed to win. He also stood, unsuccessfully, as the Liberal candidate in the South of Scotland constituency at the European Parliament elections of that year.
Four years later, he would earn the Liberal nomination for the seat of Orkney and Shetland, the seat being vacated by former party leader Jo Grimond, and won election to the Parliament. At the time, it was extremely rare for Liberal candidates to successfully win elections to succeed former Liberal MPs, although many have since done so. He was to serve as the MP there for 18 years, occupying a number of front bench posts for the Liberal Party (and, from 1988 onwards, the Liberal Democrats), including Employment spokesman and Chief Whip.
In 1992, he was unopposed in becoming the new leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, succeeding Malcolm Bruce. Scottish politics at this time was dominated by the question of constitutional reform. There were few opportunities for legislation affecting Scots Law to be debated or effectively scrutinised at Westminster and, especially after the 1987 Election, with only ten Conservative MPs in Scotland but with a large majority in the House of Commons, it was argued that there was a democratic deficit in Scotland.
He led the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the first election to the new Scottish Parliament in 1999, himself winning the constituency of Orkney with 67% of the votes cast. This meant he served as a Member of both the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments for a time with a dual mandate, although like other MPs elected to Holyrood (such as John Swinney, John Home Robertson and Donald Gorrie) he stood down from Westminster at the 2001 General Election.

Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
As expected, the proportional election system for the new Scottish Parliament meant that Labour failed to gain an outright majority in the first elections. Their leader, Donald Dewar, chose to seek a formal coalition government with a working majority rather than try to operate as a minority government.

Deputy First Minister[edit]
He contacted Wallace and a week of formal negotiations were held between the two parties' representatives, following which a partnership agreement was signed, committing both parties to support a negotiated joint agenda. Wallace became Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice, and maintained these briefs throughout the first term of the Parliament.[4]The decision to enter a coalition government with Labour was controversial at the time. British politicians were unaccustomed to coalition politics, and the Liberal Democrats came under fire from Conservative and SNP opponents who claimed they had 'sold out' their principles. Key to this criticism was the Labour policy of making students pay tuition fees, which the Liberal Democrats had promised to abolish as their price of entering a coalition, but which became merely the subject of an inquiry as the coalition was formed.
In the event, the Liberal Democrats did insist on the abolition of tuition fees after the inquiry reported in 2001, but in 1999, the delay was perceived to have been a compromise, and Wallace in particular became the focal point for extremely bitter criticism. Despite this, and other difficult moments, he and his party stayed firm and remained in power. Wallace established himself as a minister.

Acting First Minister[edit]
On three occasions over the first term of the Parliament, he became Acting First Minister: twice in 2000 due to at first the illness, and later the death, of the first First Minister Donald Dewar, and then again in 2001, after the resignation of Dewar's successor as First Minister, Henry McLeish. Each occasion lasted for only a few weeks.
Under his continued leadership, the Scottish Liberal Democrats' popularity grew steadily. After leading the party through the second Holyrood elections in 2003 Elections, again winning 17 MSPs but with a higher share of the vote, he led the party into a second coalition with Labour. The 2003 coalition negotiation process was widely seen as a more successful enterprise by the Liberal Democrats than the preceding one, with key aspects of Labour's proposals on anti-social behaviour dropped or limited, and with the promise of proportional representation for Scotland's 32 local councils.
Wallace remained as Deputy First Minister, but left the Justice brief, becoming instead the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.[5]
Resignation and peerage[edit]
On 9 May 2005, following the 2005 General Election, Wallace announced his intention to stand down as party leader and Deputy First Minister. He would remain as MSP for Orkney until the 2007 election, but would serve his time out as a backbencher. He ceased to be an MSP with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament on 2 April 2007.
On 13 September 2007, it was announced that he was to be appointed to the House of Lords.[6] He was subsequently created a life peer on 17 October 2007 taking the title Baron Wallace of Tankerness, of Tankerness in Orkney.[7] Wallace also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2007 [8]On 28 April 2008, it was announced that the new Lord Wallace would be a member of the Commission on Scottish Devolution, chaired by Sir Kenneth Calman, established by the Scottish Parliament to consider the future powers of the Parliament, including powers over finance. This is a distinct exercise from the SNP Government's national conversation.
In November 2008, Wallace received a lifetime achievement award in the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards.[9]In May 2010, he was appointed Advocate General for Scotland, one of the Law Officers of the Crown, who advise the government on Scots law.[10]He was elected unopposed, as the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords on 15 October 2013, replacing Lord McNally, who had stepped down earlier in the month.[11]In September 2016, he stepped down as the Leader of the Liberal Democrat in the House of Lords, citing a desire to step back from ""frontline"" politics stating ""I was first elected to the House of Commons 33 years ago. For 28 of these years, I have been on the frontline, including sixteen years in a leadership role, here in the Lords and in Scotland.""[12]
Honours and awards[edit]
In 2018 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[13]
Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland[edit]
A longstanding Elder of the Church of Scotland at St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, he was nominated and appointed to be Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2021–2022.[14][15][16] It is highly unusual for a lay person to be nominated as Moderator, predecessors being Alison Elliot in 2004 and George Buchanan in 1567.[17]
Personal life[edit]
Wallace married Rosemary (née Fraser) a speech therapist in 1983, who he calls ""Rosie"". The couple have two daughters: Helen and Clare.[18] He has two sons-in-law, Andrew and James, and two granddaughters, Catriona and Ella.
Wallace is an elder of the Church of Scotland, attending St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall, Orkney.

She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South Scotland region from 2011 to 2021. 
McAlpine is known for her opposition to reforming the Gender Recognition Act and for her views on sex and gender.

Background[edit]
McAlpine was born in Gourock, Renfrewshire, and attended St Ninian's Primary School in Gourock and St Columba's High School in Greenock. She has an MA (Hons) in Scottish History and Economic History from University of Glasgow.[2] She also has a Postgraduate Diploma in newspaper journalism from City University in London. McAlpine was formerly married to the writer and musician Pat Kane, with whom she has two daughters.[3][4]McAlpine began her career at the Greenock Telegraph in 1987. She went on to work for The Scotsman and The Sunday Times, where she won the Scottish Journalist of the Year award in 1999. In 2000 she was appointed editor of The Sunday Times Scotland and the following year became deputy editor of The Herald; the first woman to hold the post,[5] although not the first Scottish female newspaper editor. She also wrote a weekly column for The Scotsman[6] and the Daily record.[7] In an online vote, her blog, Go Lassie Go, was voted the Scotblog Awards' top mainstream media blog in 2010.[8][9]Go Lassie Go has not been updated since 2011.
In 1994 McAlpine co-authored a book on the history of the anti-poll tax campaign, A Time to Rage, with the political activist Tommy Sheridan.[10] In 1999 a programme Border Television written and presented by McAlpine, Crossing the Border, received a commendation but no award at the New York Television Festival.[5]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
McAlpine was elected as a list MSP for the South of Scotland region in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. She has been a media adviser for the SNP.[11] McAlpine wrote speeches for the then First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond,[12][13] and served as his Parliamentary Liaison Officer.
In November 2011 a member of McAlpine's staff, Gail Lythgoe, was found to have emailed a women's equality group, alleging that the Labour politician Ian Davidson has a history of bullying women and called on them to demonstrate against him whilst asking them not to reveal SNP involvement in the demonstration's instigation.[14][15] The email was later leaked and Lythgoe publicly apologised for making unsubstantiated allegations, with the Labour Party stating that this was a result of an SNP ""dirty tricks campaign"" against Davidson and calling for an investigation.[14]In January 2012 as MSPs debated plans on the timing of an independence referendum, McAlpine told the Scottish Parliament that: ""I absolutely make no apology for saying that the Liberals, the Labour Party and the Tories are anti-Scottish"", provoking widespread condemnation from other political parties.[16] Scottish Labour's then Deputy Leader Anas Sarwar said: ""What is being questioned here is my commitment and my love of my country. The country in which I was born and brought up, the country to which my grandfather came in 1939 with nothing and made a life for himself. This is really serious.""[17]In March 2012, McAlpine compared Scotland's place in the United Kingdom with a woman in an abusive marriage with a domineering man and stated that rival political parties were behaving in a sexist and misogynistic manner.[18] Labour MP Margaret Curran said: ""Comparing the United Kingdom to an abusive marriage is absurd and offensive to men or women genuinely trapped in that kind of relationship.""[18]In May 2012, McAlpine was reprimanded by the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament for failure to appear for Ministerial Questions to be asked a question which she had tabled in the Scottish Parliament, she was eating dinner in a restaurant.[19][20]In February 2014 McAlpine referred herself to the Scottish Parliament's Presiding Officer after concerns were raised that she had broken Parliamentary rules while claiming expenses.[21] McAlpine had invoiced the taxpayer for £1750 after she employed landscape photographer Jane McLachlan for ten days to take shots for her constituency publications.[22] However, prior to her election McAlpine had had an affair with McLachlan's husband, Mark.[23] McLachlan claimed that the photography work had never been carried out and McAlpine repaid the money in 2012.[21] She was later cleared of any wrongdoing and Derek Croll, head of financial resources at Holyrood, concluded: ""The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body considered a report on the matter at its meeting this morning. I am writing to inform you [Joan McAlpine] that, on the basis of the report and annexes presented to the corporate body, the SPCB determined that there was no evidence that a breach of the rules of the scheme has taken place.""[22]McAlpine ran as the SNP candidate for Dumfriesshire in the 2016 and 2021 Scottish Parliament elections, losing to Oliver Mundell. She also stood on the SNP list for South Scotland, but in 2021 failed to win re-election.

Views on sex and gender[edit]
In February 2019, McAlpine tweeted explaining her belief that the Scottish census should record biological sex in order to monitor sex discrimination, and questioning the influence of key stakeholders in the Scottish government's consultation process.[24] This led to her receiving online abuse including threats from some claiming to be SNP members that they would attempt to deselect her as a MSP, despite the fact that no deselection mechanism exists within the SNP.[25] Her claims about the funding and role of several women's organisations led to the publication of an open-letter rebuking her claims, signed by organisations including Engender Scotland, Equate Scotland and Close the Gap.[26] In May 2019, McAlpine's invitation for gender critical feminist Meghan Murphy to speak at Holyrood caused further controversy as a result of Murphy's perceived trans-exclusionary views.[27] Writing in The Spectator, Stephen Daisley described McAlpine as ""gender critical"" and described the negative reaction she had received for her stance.[26]In 2019, the Scottish Parliament debated the Census (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill regarding a proposal from National Records of Scotland (NRS) to include a non-binary sex option on the 2021 UK census in Scotland.[28] Prior to the debate, the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Relations Committee, of which McAlpine was the convenor, published a ""highly critical"" report, decrying the lack of consultation with women's groups and stating that this had led the NRS to conflate sex and gender identity.[28] Speaking during the Stage 3 debate of the Census (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill, McAlpine quoted Simone de Beauvoir, criticising the fact that ""Stonewall's trans umbrella includes people with no medical treatment who refute the contention that they have a psychological condition"" and stated that she ""reject[s] the concept of innate gender identity"".[29] Following the debate, McAlpine wrote an article published in The Times newspaper, stating that she believed women would be erased ""as a biological sex class"" if a non-binary sex option were to be included.[30] McAlpine did, however, vote in favour of the bill, which was passed unanimously.[28][31]In November 2019, it was announced that McAlpine and Labour MSP Jenny Marra would be hosting an event on behalf of the ""Women's Human Rights Campaign"", an international campaign that launched in New York in March 2019. The campaign states that its focus is on ""the importance of keeping the current sex based definition of woman"". The announcement was met with criticism from some feminist and LGBT groups, including Engender, The Equality Network and the Scottish Trans Alliance, who expressed their concerns that the Campaign's aims would breach Human Rights law, and in particular the rights of transgender people. A spokeswoman for the Campaign responded that their aim was to ""re-affirm women's sex-based rights, as set out in international human rights documents"".[32]

Personal detailsBorn (1967-04-01) 1 April 1967 (age 56)Dundee, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materAbertay UniversityWebsitewww.joe.fitzpatrick.scotJoseph Martin FitzPatrick (born 1 April 1967) is a Scottish politician who has served as Minister for Local Government Empowerment and Planning since March 2023. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Dundee City West since the 2007. Prior to his Ministerial appointment, he was Convener of the Scottish Parliament's Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee.[1] He served as Minister for Public Health, Sport and Wellbeing from 2018 to until his resignation in 2020.[2][3][4] He also served as Minister for Parliamentary Business from 2012 to 2018.

Early life, education and career[edit]
Joseph Martin FitzPatrick was born on 1 April 1967 in Dundee, Scotland. He attended Whitfield Primary School and Whitfield High School. He studied Forestry at Inverness College and worked for the Forestry Commission in Angus and Tillhill Forestry in ArgyIl.
He was elected President of Inverness College Students Association and was re-elected as the College's first Sabbatical President. He was elected to the National Executive of NUS in 1990 and was given specific responsibility for LGBT issues. He was later elected as the Area Convenor for the National Union of Students from1991 1992.
Before his election to the Scottish Parliament, FitzPatrick worked for Dundee SNP parliamentarians Shona Robison MSP and Stewart Hosie MP and was also a Dundee City Council member, SNP group whip and finance spokesperson.

Political career[edit]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
After being elected MSP for Dundee West, he was elected as the SNP Group Secretary in the Parliament and was a member of the Finance Committee and SNP substitute on the Health Committee. He was also the Parliamentary Liaison Officer to John Swinney MSP (Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth).
In 2007, FitzPatrick was elected to the SNP's National Executive Committee. In 2009 he co-ordinated the SNP's successful European Election Campaign.[5]In 2011, FitzPatrick was re-elected to the slightly enlarged Dundee City west seat with an increased majority and 57.6% of the vote. FitzPatrick went on to be appointed Convener of the Local Government and Regeneration Committee. He was Co-convener of the Cross Party Group on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency and Convener of the Cross Party Group on Computer Games Technology.
In 2012, FitzPatrick introduced a Members' Bill to tackle parking on pavements, double parking and parking alongside kerbs which have been lowered for wheelchair users. FitzPatrick stated: ""It is clear that the current situation, with complicated police enforcement, isn’t working. We need Scottish legislation that enables local authorities to take action against inconsiderate parking."" FitzPatrick stated that the Bill aimed to help pedestrians.[6]FitzPatrick was appointed Minister for Parliamentary Business in September 2012.[7] He introduced the Scottish Elections (Reduction of Voting Age) Bill in 2015.[8] The legislation allowed British, Commonwealth or EU Citizens over the age of 16 to vote in Scottish Parliament and local council elections.[9]Those aged over 16 were first allowed to vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. 3.6 million people voted in the referendum. Over 100,000 were aged 16 to 17.[10]In a debate on 'Young Voters' in the Scottish Parliament on February 19, 2015, FitzPatrick stated: ""...the referendum was a remarkable demonstration of democracy at its best, and it is right that the chamber both recognises and celebrates the impact that young people have had on politics and the opportunity that the extension of the franchise presents to our democracy.""[11]FitzPatrick introduced The Lobbying (Scotland) Act 2016. The Act became law in April 2016 and sought to ""increase public transparency about lobbying.""[12] On commending the Bill to Parliament, FitzPatrick stated: ""The collaborative relationship between the Government, the Parliament and our stakeholders throughout the bill’s development is yet another example that supports the proud reputation of this Parliament and the Government for open engagement with civic Scotland.""[13]In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election FitzPatrick increased his majority once more, winning 54.2% of the vote.[14] FitzPatrick was one of ten openly LGBT MSPs.
In June 2018, FitzPatrick was appointed Minister for Public Health, Sport and Wellbeing.
FitzPatrick introduced The Human Tissue (Authorisation) (Scotland) Bill to Parliament on 8 June 2018. It was passed by Parliament in June 2019. Having completed all the parliamentary stages, the bill received Royal Assent and came into force in autumn 2020. The legislation introduced an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors. FitzPatrick stated: ""Organ and tissue donation can be a life-changing gift. Evidence shows that opt-out systems can make a difference as part of a wider package of measures and this Act provides further opportunities to both save and improve lives.""[15]In December 2020, FitzPatrick welcomed a review which made it easier for gay and bisexual men to donate blood in Scotland. FitzPatrick stated: ""I welcome the recommendations... which will enable a more individualised risk assessment approach to blood donor safety checks while continuing to ensure the safe supply of blood to patients. We are committed to equality and inclusion, and these changes will ensure a fairer and more up to date assessment of risk is applied to both men and women to identify whether donors may be at risk of a blood-borne virus infection.""[16]In December 2020, figures were released revealing that 1,264 people in Scotland had died from drug overdoses in 2019 – the highest number in Europe and three and a half times the rate in England and Wales.[17] Activist Darren McGarvey claimed FitzPatrick as Public Health Minister was ""incapable of leading us anywhere but the mortuary""[18] and opposition parties tabled a motion of no confidence in him in Holyrood.[19] Two days before FitzPatrick left office as Public Health Minister he was challenged to attend an unsanctioned mobile drug consumption facility which was parked outside Holyrood by activist Peter Krykant. FitzPatrick supported calls for a supervised overdose prevention facility pilot in Scotland. The law to facilitate this remains reserved to the UK Government.[20] FitzPatrick stated: ""It’s clear the Misuse of Drugs Act is no longer fit for purpose. To enable innovations, such as a safer drug consumption facility, the law needs to change. We hope the UK Government will listen to the call from Scotland to make the necessary changes in the law to allow this to happen.""[21] First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told Parliament that the figures were ""indefensible"". FitzPatrick resigned, commenting that it had been the “privilege of my life to serve in the Scottish Government” but that the ""most heart-breaking and difficult problems"" he faced as public health minister were the harms and deaths caused by drug use.[22][23]In June 2022, FitzPatrick met with Krykant and charity Cranstoun in the Scottish Parliament to discuss proposals for an overdose prevention centre (OPC) in Dundee. FitzPatrick backed the calls and signed Cranstoun's pledge.[24]In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election FitzPatrick increased his majority to almost 13,000 votes over Scottish Labour.[25] He was appointed Convener of the Scottish Parliament's Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee.
In 2022, FitzPatrick led a Members' Debate in the Scottish Parliament condemning the findings of an investigation, undertaken by The Courier and Press & Journal, which found that 60% of female respondents had experienced sexism in football.[26][27][28] FitzPatrick stated to Parliament: ""I truly believe that by working together we can tackle sexism and misogyny in football and in wider society. We all know the benefits of playing sport—it improves physical and mental health, tackles isolation and loneliness and boosts self-esteem. Those benefits should be available to everyone, regardless of gender, race or ability.""[29]At First Minister's Questions on 12 May 2022, FitzPatrick condemned reports of sexist, racist and homophobic comments at the Scottish Football Writers’ Association gala dinner. Nicola Sturgeon in response stated: ""I very much agree with those sentiments. From what I have read about what occurred at that particular awards dinner, it was unacceptable. I pay tribute to Eilidh Barbour and others, who courageously took a stand against it and spoke out. It is never easy for any woman to speak out in that way, particularly in what is traditionally a man’s world, and Eilidh Barbour and her colleagues deserve credit for doing so.""[30] The Scottish Football Writers’ Association apologised after a speaker’s sexist and misogynistic jokes prompted attendees to walk out of its annual awards dinner.[31]FitzPatrick was appointed Minister for Local Government Empowerment and Planning in March 2023 by First Minister Humza Yousaf.[32]

Personal detailsBornJohann MacDougall Lamont (1957-07-11) 11 July 1957 (age 66)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Labour Co-operativeSpouseArchie GrahamChildren2EducationWoodside Secondary SchoolAlma materUniversity of GlasgowJordanhill CollegeProfessionTeacherJohann MacDougall Lamont (/ˈdʒoʊæn læmʌnt/; born 11 July 1957) is a Scottish Labour Co-operative politician who served as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2011 to 2014. She was previously a junior Scottish Executive minister from 2004 to 2007 and Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2008 until her election to the leadership in 2011. In addition to her ministerial and leadership roles, she has been a campaigner on equality issues and violence against women throughout her political career.
Born in Glasgow, Lamont attended Woodside Secondary School and obtained a degree from the University of Glasgow. After studying for teaching qualifications at Jordanhill College, she became a schoolteacher. Active in the Labour Party since she was at university, Lamont served on its Scottish Executive Committee, and chaired it in 1993. With the establishment of a devolved legislature in Scotland, she was elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Pollok in 1999. Having been appointed convener of the Scottish Parliament's Social Justice Committee in 2001, she obtained her first ministerial role in a Labour–Liberal Democrat coalition in October 2004 and served until its defeat by the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 2007.
Lamont stood for the Scottish Labour leadership following the resignation of Iain Gray in the wake of the party's defeat at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election; its second consecutive defeat. Following a review of how the Labour Party in Scotland would be structured, she became its first overall leader. She stated Labour lost the 2011 election because it had lost direction, and initiated a review of Scottish Labour policy on issues like devolution and the party's commitment to free universal public services. Following the SNP Government's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence, she was a key figure in the Better Together campaign; a cross-party movement that sought to keep Scotland part of the United Kingdom. She resigned as Scottish Labour leader in October 2014, making the announcement in a Daily Record interview in which she claimed that senior figures within the UK Labour Party had undermined her attempts to reform the Scottish party, and treated it ""like a branch office of London"". Following a leadership election to replace her, she was succeeded in December 2014 by former Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy.
Lamont's work as Scottish Labour leader won her accolades at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards, for Political Impact of the Year in 2012 and Debater of the Year in 2013. In parliamentary debates, she was perceived by commentators such as The Scotsman's Andrew Whitaker as being an effective opponent to First Minister Alex Salmond, but others, including Richard Seymour of The Guardian, criticised her for clumsiness during television interviews.

Early life and teaching career[edit]
Johann MacDougall Lamont was born in the Anderston district of Glasgow on 11 July 1957.[1][2] Her parents, Archie and Effie, were both Gaelic speakers from crofting families on the Inner Hebridean island of Tiree, who met after both had moved to Glasgow.[2][3] Archie was a carpenter employed by the Scottish ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, working on the Mallaig to Skye route. He took part in the Seamen's Strike of 1966.[3] The family were Presbyterians, and Lamont's mother was influenced in her faith by the American evangelist Billy Graham.[3][4] Her first experiences of public speakers was listening to the preachers her mother took her to see as a girl.[3]Lamont's childhood was divided between Glasgow and her mother's family home on Tiree, where she and her brother David spent their summer holidays.[3] She attended Woodside Secondary School, having declined to take scholarship exams for selective education.[5][6] Like her parents, she was a Gaelic speaker,[3] but she did not believe she spoke it well enough, and she dropped it at school in favour of French and German.[3] It was also at school that she first developed an interest in politics, once entering a Daily Mirror competition with a politically-themed short story. The tale, whose central character discussed her intention to demand a pay rise and was finally revealed to be the Queen, won Lamont third prize.[7] She studied English and History at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an MA.[5] Joining the Labour Party in 1975, she was active in Glasgow University Labour Club where she was a contemporary of fellow Labour politician Margaret Curran, and was also involved with the women's movement.[6][8][9] She trained as a teacher for a year at Jordanhill College, gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, and afterwards joined Rothesay Academy, as a teacher in 1979.[3][10][11] She taught at Springburn Academy in Glasgow from 1982 to 1989 and at Castlemilk High School, also in Glasgow, from 1990 to 1999. Lamont taught English and worked with social workers and educational psychologists attempting to tackle instances of school truancy.[3][10]Continuing to be active in the Labour Party, Lamont became a prominent campaigner on issues related to social justice, equality and devolution.[12] Although she had voted no in the 1979 referendum that proposed the establishment of a Scottish Assembly,[13] during the 1980s and 1990s she was a representative on the Scottish Constitutional Convention, the body that paved the way for Scottish devolution.[12][14] Of her 1979 decision, Lamont has said that she ""came from the strand on the left which saw the politics of nationalism as a diversion from more central aims [but later] came to see the parliament as a vehicle for democratic change in Scotland.""[13] She was a member of the Scottish Executive Committee of the Labour Party, serving as chair in 1993.[15]
MSP for Glasgow Pollok[edit]
Although a Labour activist for two decades, Lamont had not sought election to the House of Commons during that time, telling a 2014 BBC interview there were few chances for women to be elected to Westminster: ""In 1987 Labour sent down 50 MPs and only one of them was a woman.""[9] Instead, her decision to seek political office was influenced by the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Speaking to The Herald in 2011, she said, ""It is easy to forget what a great opportunity it was for women and I was determined that women would be represented, would have a strong voice.""[16] The parliament was established as a result of the 1997 referendum that saw a 74% vote in favour of devolving legislative powers to Scotland.[17] Lamont was first elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Pollok in 1999.[18] She held the seat in 2003, when she faced a strong challenge from the Scottish Socialist Party leader Tommy Sheridan,[19][20] and then again in 2007 and 2011.[21][22]During her maiden speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont was the first MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament.[3][23][24] She served on a number of the Parliament's committees during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee.[23] She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001.[25][26] In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation.[27] At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.[28][29]
Frontbench politics[edit]
Lamont was appointed convener of the Communities Committee in 2003.[30] In March 2004 the Committee endorsed a bill aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour, which included plans for parenting orders and the electronic tagging of youths under the age of 16.[31] First Minister Jack McConnell made her Deputy Minister for Communities in the Scottish Executive in October 2004.[32] In that post she was responsible for the launch of a radio and television advertising campaign aimed at tackling domestic abuse that aired over Christmas 2005,[33] and she expressed concerns over the level of discrimination faced by travellers and gypsies after the issue was highlighted in a 2005 Scottish Parliament report.[34]In November 2006, Lamont was appointed Deputy Minister for Justice[35] and oversaw reforms to Scotland's Lower Courts system.[34] She held the post until Labour was defeated at the 2007 election.[10] McConnell appointed her as Labour's spokesperson for Communities and Sport in his post-election frontbench team,[36] a role she retained in the shadow cabinet formed by his successor, Wendy Alexander, in September 2007.[37] Following Alexander's decision to step down as leader of the Labour MSPs in June 2008, and Cathy Jamieson's subsequent resignation as her deputy, Lamont stood against fellow MSP Bill Butler for the position vacated by Jamieson. She was elected as deputy leader in September 2008 with 60.16 per cent of the vote, against 39.82 per cent for Butler. At the same time, Iain Gray was elected to lead the Labour group at Holyrood.[38][39]In addition to her deputy leadership role, Lamont was appointed Chief of Staff with special responsibility for Equalities.[40] While in that post she gave her support to Scottish Government plans to introduce a Bill outlawing forced marriage, which was announced in September 2010.[41] In February 2011, she criticised Scottish Conservative MSP and Justice Committee Convener, Bill Aitken after the Sunday Herald quoted him making a controversial statement about a rape victim,[42] and later welcomed his subsequent resignation.[43] As Gray's deputy Lamont also represented Labour at First Minister's Questions in his absence. At a session of First Minister's Questions in October 2009, she raised the issue of the Scottish Futures Trust with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, asking whether the public body planned to spend any money on improving school infrastructure before the 2011 election.[44]
Leader of the Scottish Labour Party[edit]
Leadership election[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011In the wake of Labour's second defeat at the Scottish Parliament election of May 2011, which saw the Scottish National Party (SNP) form its first majority government, Gray announced his intention to step down as leader of the Labour MSPs later that year.[45]A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had.[45][46][47][48] Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011[49] and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University.[50] She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: ""We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns. Our real challenge is that we in Labour lost our way, lost our confidence and lost Scotland.""[50]Lamont's opponents in the leadership race were the MP Tom Harris, and her fellow MSP Ken Macintosh, both of whom had also expressed a need for Labour to change if it was to win the next election.[51][52] Harris's campaign centred on the belief that Labour had to ""[re-establish] itself as the party of aspiration"", or it would risk becoming ""an irrelevance"".[53] Macintosh felt the party had focused too heavily on its traditional support in the Central Belt while paying less attention to rural communities.[53] He suggested increasing government help to tackle unemployment among young people, and wanted to nationalise rail and bus services.[53]The result of the election was announced on 17 December 2011 and saw Lamont secure an overall majority with 51.77% of the vote in the first round. Her closest rival was Macintosh with 40.28%, while Harris was third with 7.95%. Lamont also won majorities in two groups of Labour's three-tier electoral college system, securing the support of parliamentarians and affiliated bodies such as trade unions. Macintosh was backed by the majority of individual party members.[45][54] In her acceptance speech, Lamont told party activists, ""Together we will change the Scottish Labour Party and win the chance to serve the people of Scotland again and make Scotland all that we know it can be.""[55] On the same day, MP Anas Sarwar was elected to the position of Deputy that Lamont had vacated.[45]
Shadow Cabinet[edit]
Lamont began appointing members of her shadow cabinet on 19 December 2011. Those given positions on her initial frontbench team include Macintosh (Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth), Hugh Henry (Labour spokesman for Education and Lifelong Learning), Lewis Macdonald (Shadow Justice Minister) and Boyack (Local Government and Planning). The post of Shadow Health Minister was given to Jackie Baillie, who had held the position previously.[56][57] Gray was not included, as he had expressed a wish to take a break from frontline politics.[58]Lamont announced a major shakeup of the Labour frontbench team on 28 June 2013. Gray returned to replace Macintosh as the party's finance spokesman. Macdonald was appointed chief whip, and his previous role as Shadow Justice Minister was given to Graeme Pearson. Baillie was moved from Health to Social Justice and Welfare. Boyack kept her role in Local Government and Planning.[59] Speaking about the reshuffle, Lamont said, ""We have made a great deal of progress in the last 18 months but we have to keep moving forward.""[59]
First months in office[edit]
Lamont gave her first post-election interview to The Politics Show Scotland on 18 December 2011, speaking of the ""huge challenge"" of rebuilding public trust in Scottish Labour after its election defeat of the previous May, and a general decline in support over the preceding decade.[60] Attributing the party's losses to its failure to engage with the electorate, she told the programme that Labour needed to speak up for the interests of the Scottish people, and accept more devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament.[60] Attending her first session of First Minister's Questions as Labour leader on 22 December 2011, she addressed the issue of child neglect following the conviction of a Glasgow woman for the murder of her son and asking what lessons could be learned from the case.[61]In January 2012, as the SNP Government prepared for a referendum on Scottish independence, she spoke out in defence of Scotland's position in the United Kingdom after First Minister Salmond claimed that the country was not an equal partner in the union.[62] Along with Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie, the respective leaders of the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats, and Deputy First Minister Sturgeon, Lamont added her signature to a February 2012 letter urging Glasgow City Council to decline an application by the Scottish Defence League to stage a march through the city.[63] The group, an offshoot of the far-right English Defence League, subsequently withdrew their application, and a ""static"" demonstration was held instead.[64][65]Lamont gave her first conference speech as party leader at Scottish Labour's conference in March 2012, setting out an agenda for rebuilding confidence in the party.[66] Later the same month she welcomed the passing of the Scotland Bill, which devolved further powers to Scotland in accordance with the recommendations of the Calman Commission, praising it as ""an important development of devolution"".[67] In May 2012 she participated in the Scottish Parliament debate paying tribute to Queen Elizabeth as the UK celebrated her Diamond Jubilee. Lamont commented, ""60 years in the one job is good going – I've been in this one for just six months and some days, I have to say, it feels like 60 years – so we recognise the scale of the achievement of the particular, very strong woman.""[68] Lamont was a guest on the 7 June 2012 edition of the BBC's political debate programme Question Time.[69]
Standing in the polls[edit]
A poll conducted by Ipsos MORI in December 2011 as Lamont took control of Scottish Labour indicated that the party had an approval rating of 26%, almost half that of the Scottish National Party with 51%.[70] A survey by the same organisation in June 2012 showed an improvement for Labour, with 32% against the Nationalists' 45%.[71] The same poll indicated a personal approval rating for Lamont of 9%, compared to 13% for Salmond.[72] A poll conducted by Ipsos MORI on behalf of STV in September 2013 indicated that 37% of respondents were satisfied with Labour's performance compared to 41% for the SNP.[73] That survey found that Lamont had a personal approval rating of +6%, against +8% for Salmond.[74] Another Ipsos MORI poll for STV in December 2013 showed Labour on 34% with 36% for the SNP, while Lamont had overtaken Salmond in terms of personal approval with +9 for her compared to +7 for the First Minister.[75]A poll on the issue of Scottish independence conducted by TNS-BMRB in December 2013 gave Lamont an approval rating of 6% among women and 8% among men, compared with 22% and 30% respectively for Salmond. 41% of respondents to that survey were unaware of her role as Scottish Labour leader, a figure rising to 62% among those aged 16–34.[76]
Local elections and by-elections[edit]
Lamont launched Labour's 2012 local election campaign in Edinburgh on 17 April 2012, setting out policies for creating employment and training opportunities as well as improvements to education and childcare. Claiming that the SNP Government had passed on 89 per cent of the spending cuts imposed by the UK Government, she compared the Nationalists to the businessman criticised for his role in the financial collapse of Glasgow Rangers Football Club, saying, ""Putting the SNP in charge of a council is like putting Craig Whyte in charge of your tax return.""[77][78] Retaining control of Glasgow City Council, where Labour was facing a strong challenge from the SNP, was another of the party's key objectives.[77] After the polls, political academic John Curtice, writing for The Guardian, observed that Lamont ""has undoubtedly done enough to dispel doubts about whether she was the right woman for the job"".[79]The 2013 Dunfermline by-election was triggered by the resignation of the SNP's Bill Walker in the wake of his conviction on several accounts of domestic abuse.[80] On the eve of the poll, Alan Cochrane of The Daily Telegraph described it as an election Labour could not afford to lose because, ""For [Lamont's] personal prestige, her candidate simply must win.""[80] Labour won the seat with a swing of 7 per cent from the SNP and a majority of 2,873.[81] Lamont said that the result reflected ""the progress we've made"",[82] but Curtice said that if the results were repeated across Scotland, the SNP would still be the majority party at the next election.[81]Labour also increased their support at other by-elections. At the 2013 Aberdeen Donside by-election in June, held after the death of the SNP's Brian Adam, Labour reduced the SNP majority from 7,789 to 2,025.[83] The 2014 Cowdenbeath by-election was held following the death of Labour MSP Helen Eadie.[84] The campaign was fought on issues such as education, employment and care for the elderly, and saw Labour increase their share of the vote, with an 11.25 per cent swing from the SNP and a majority of 5,488.[85]
Scottish independence and enhanced devolution[edit]
Lamont (second from right) alongside Anas Sarwar, Gordon Brown and Margaret Curran at the launch of United with LabourLamont was a prominent figure in the Better Together Campaign, the cross-party political movement founded to keep Scotland as part of the United Kingdom following the SNP's announcement of a referendum on Scottish independence in 2014.[86][87][88] She was outspoken in her opposition to Scottish independence, using a keynote speech at UK Labour's 2013 conference in Brighton to accuse the SNP of nurturing hostility between Scotland and the rest of the UK, and describing nationalism as a ""virus that has affected so many nations and done so much harm"".[89] Lamont is in favour of greater devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament, and established a Commission to look at how this can be achieved.[90][91]
2014 referendum and Better Together campaign[edit]
After taking office as Labour leader in December 2011, Lamont urged First Minister Salmond to set a date for the referendum, arguing in her leadership acceptance speech that uncertainty over the referendum's timeline was having a negative impact on Scotland.[45] On 10 January 2012 Salmond announced late 2014 as his preferred time for a referendum.[92] The Scottish Government confirmed the referendum question on 25 January 2012,[93] and announced on 21 March 2013 that the referendum would be held on 18 September 2014.[94] Lamont told Scottish Labour's 2012 annual conference she wanted her party's campaign to be one of ""collective leadership"" against independence,[95] a strategy which she envisaged would become a cross-party movement arguing the case for keeping Scotland in the UK.[96][97] At the Scottish Conservative Party conference a few weeks later, party leader Ruth Davidson called for Lamont and her opponents to work together.[98] The Better Together Campaign, fronted by former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, was launched at an event attended by Lamont and other senior Scottish political figures at Edinburgh's Napier University on 25 June 2012.[86] Along with former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other senior Scottish Labour figures, Lamont launched the party's own pro-union campaign, United with Labour in May 2013.[99][100] The Scottish Government published Scotland's Future, a white paper setting out its vision for an independent Scotland, on 26 November 2013. Lamont dismissed it as ""670 pages of assertion and uncertainty"".[101][102] Addressing the Shadow Cabinet of UK Labour leader Ed Miliband on 28 January 2014, Lamont warned that Scots could vote for independence if they believed Labour was unlikely to win the 2015 UK general election.[103]Opinion polls showed an increase in support for the Yes campaign as the referendum approached. On 8 September 2014, Gordon Brown set out plans for greater devolved powers for Holyrood in the event of a No vote. Lamont joined Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie in giving her backing to the proposals the following day, but Salmond dismissed them as ""a retreading, a repackaging, a re-timetabling"" of previous promises. Prime Minister David Cameron and Opposition leader Ed Miliband cancelled their appearance at Prime Minister's Questions to travel to Scotland to campaign for a No vote.[104] On 18 September, Scotland voted to reject independence with a majority of 2,001,926 to 1,617,989.[105] Salmond announced his intention to resign as First Minister and SNP leader on 19 September, shortly after the result of the referendum was confirmed. Lamont paid tribute to him, describing him as ""an immense figure in Scottish political history"".[105] Sturgeon was chosen to succeed Salmond as SNP leader on 15 October.[106]
Labour's Commission on devolution[edit]
At the Scottish Labour Party Conference in March 2012, Lamont announced her intention to establish a Commission to examine the prospect of a fully devolved Scottish Parliament.[90][91] This would give the Scottish Government the power to make decisions on policies relating to issues such as welfare benefits, income tax and corporation tax, effectively making it a fully self-governing region of the United Kingdom.[90] The Commission, chaired by Lamont and including politicians, academics and trade union members, met for the first time in October 2012.[91] It published an interim report in April 2013, recommending that Scotland have autonomy over income tax, but leaving decisions on corporation tax and welfare to the UK Parliament.[107][108] But party members opposed it, warning that the plans could threaten the Barnett formula, the financial mechanism under which Scotland receives an annual average of £1,600 per head more in UK Government spending than does the rest of the UK.[107]Ian Davidson, chair of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee said the proposals could affect spending in poorer areas.[107] Macintosh subsequently warned that devolving responsibility for income tax would reduce the Scottish tax base and result in independence by default,[109] a claim that Guy Lodge and Alan Trench of the Institute for Public Policy Research called ""highly disingenuous"" because income tax makes up only 23% of the taxes collected by the UK Government.[110]The Commission's final report, Powers for a Purpose was published on 18 March 2014, setting out recommendations that would be implemented if Scotland voted no in the referendum, and Labour were elected in 2015.[111][112][113] The proposals included allowing the Scottish Parliament to raise as much as 40% of its annual revenue, and giving it greater leeway to vary income tax rates from those in the rest of the UK.[114][115] The plans would build on the powers devolved under the 2012 Scotland Act, which legislated for an increase in responsibility over taxation from 2016, in exchange for a 10% reduction in the grant received from Westminster.[111][115][116] The Commission also recommended devolving responsibility in some other fiscal areas, such as the payment of Housing Benefit and the possible levy of a mansion tax in Scotland, but decided against taking charge of other financial matters, including state pensions, National Insurance and tariffs on North Sea oil.[111] Other proposals were to retain the Barnett formula, give Scotland control over its railways, and transfer authority for dissolving parliament and holding elections from Westminster to Holyrood.[112][115] Lamont described the proposals as ""the right balance between fiscal accountability and insuring us against risk"".[117] Ben Thomson, chair of the cross-party Devo Plus think tank argued the plans were ""just tinkering with the current system"" and would allow the SNP to ""say that the unionist parties aren't interested in real devolution"".[118] Deputy First Minister Sturgeon welcomed the prospect of increased devolution, but said a vote for independence was the only way to ensure greater powers for Scotland as ""there [was] no guarantee that any new powers would be delivered in the event of a no vote"".[111] The proposals were subsequently endorsed by delegates at Scottish Labour's 2014 party conference.[119]
Free public services debate[edit]
In September 2012, Lamont announced a policy review of Scotland's universal benefits, signalling that a future Labour administration would reverse many of the free services introduced since power was devolved to Scotland.[120] Launching the review at an address to party delegates in Edinburgh, she questioned whether services such as prescriptions and tuition fees—which are free in Scotland—should continue to be available to all, regardless of income, and suggested the situation was unsustainable:[121] ""I believe our resources must go to those in greatest need ... Salmond's most cynical trick was to make people believe that more was free, when the poorest are paying for the tax breaks for the rich ... Scotland cannot be the only something-for-nothing country in the world.""[120][121]The speech was condemned by the SNP, which branded it as ""Blairite"", while deputy party leader Sturgeon called the strategy ""disastrous"".[10][121] The approach was also questioned by Richard Seymour of The Guardian, who suggested it could damage Labour's electoral appeal: ""Outside Scotland, this policy would merely be a gift to the Tories, by corroborating their arguments for welfare cuts. In Scotland, it reminds ex-Labour voters why they defected to the SNP: as a defensive shield against such policies.""[122]Owen Jones of The Independent suggested it was ""a baffling political strategy to outflank the SNP from the right"".[123]Lamont returned to the issue of universal tuition fees again in a speech in Glasgow on 17 December 2012 to mark the first anniversary of her election as Labour leader. She suggested that the Graduate Endowment, a system abolished by the SNP Government, could be reinstated if Labour were re-elected at the next Scottish parliamentary election. Ian Grant, a retired college principal, welcomed her comments as ""courageous"", but Jamie Kinlochan, a member of the National Union of Students Scotland expressed concerns that students would be discouraged by extra financial costs on top of loans and other expenses.[124]In January 2014, Lamont and Scottish Labour faced criticism after the party voted against an SNP motion that included the introduction of free school meals for pupils in their first three years of primary education, and a commitment to childcare for pre-school children.[125] The motion also contained measures that would only be implemented in the event of Scottish independence, something Labour said it could not support.[125][126] Recalling her experience of teaching underprivileged children, Lamont told the parliament that free school meals would not be her priority, and tabled an unsuccessful amendment calling for greater childcare provisions instead.[126][127] The motion was later passed by a majority of 67–46.[128] In The Daily Telegraph, Cochrane wrote that the strategy had allowed the SNP to claim Labour opposed the principle of free school meals because they ""fell for a bit of skulduggery that Ms Lamont and her business managers should have seen coming a mile off"".[125]
Falkirk candidate selection row and Grangemouth dispute[edit]
In 2013, Labour and Police Scotland launched separate investigations into claims that officials of the Unite union had signed their members up to Labour to get their preferred candidate adopted to represent the party in the Falkirk constituency. The union officials were later cleared of any wrongdoing.[129] It was later claimed that key evidence thought to have been retracted had not been withdrawn, prompting several Falkirk councillors to urge Miliband to publish details of the party's internal inquiry or to hold a fresh investigation.[129] On the 4 November edition of Good Morning Scotland, Lamont said there was a case for a fresh inquiry, but that Labour does not publish details of its internal investigations.[129][130] Later the same day, Labour said that it would not be reopening the investigation.[131] Miliband subsequently said that a new investigation was unnecessary.[132] On 8 December the former MSP Karen Whitefield was selected to contest the seat.[133] The report into Labour's inquiry was leaked to the media in February 2014, and concluded there was ""no doubt"" that Unite had attempted to manipulate the selection process.[134]In October 2013 Lamont faced criticism for her reaction to an industrial dispute at the Grangemouth Oil Refinery.[135]Ineos, the company that operates the plant, had stated that the refinery was making financial losses, and had proposed a survival plan requiring employees to accept worse employment terms, notably changes in work rules and less generous pensions; this the employees rejected. The company mothballed the plant, threatening to close it if the terms were not accepted.[135] Lamont urged Ineos to withdraw its conditions and for both sides to hold talks, while Salmond tried to negotiate an agreement. Union officials eventually agreed not to call a strike for at least three years, and the plant reopened.[136] The Ineos chairman, Calum MacLean, described Lamont's support for the trade unions during the dispute as ""deeply irresponsible"", while Salmond claimed she had been silent throughout the disagreement.[135][136] Writing for the Dunfermline Press, Natalie McGarry suggested that while the Labour leader's silence probably had much to do with the continuing Falkirk selection row, ultimately she was ""found wanting"".[137]
Resignation[edit]
Scotland voted by a 10% margin against independence, but the referendum returned ""Yes"" votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader.[138] Shortly after the referendum, Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy was discussing taking over from her,[139] while The Herald reported that party delegates concerned about the results had started to view Murphy as a possible successor.[140] Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister's Questions, the first of the post-referendum era. ""When the First Minister is long gone I will still be doing my job on behalf of the people of Scotland.""[138] Her position remained uncertain. Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership.[141] In October, two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party. McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described the party as ""a political machine that is angry about what has happened in Scotland in the recent past"".[142] Shortly afterwards, his predecessor, Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded ""enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily"" because its supporters no longer understood ""what the party stands for"".[142] Margaret Curran, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said that although the party was changing, it needed to reconnect with its ""socialist principles"".[143]Lamont's resignation as Labour leader was reported by media outlets on the evening of 24 October 2014, following the publication of an interview with the Daily Record in which she announced her intention to step down with immediate effect.[141][144] She told the newspaper that she was resigning because Labour's Westminster leadership had undermined her attempts to reform the party in Scotland, and treated Scottish Labour ""like a branch office of London.""[141] She described some London-based colleagues as ""dinosaurs"" unable to understand that ""Scotland has changed forever"" following the referendum. Lamont was also angry that she had not been consulted on some matters, such as a decision by the UK leadership to replace Ian Price as Scottish Labour's General Secretary.[144][145] In her letter of resignation, submitted to Scottish Labour Party Chairman Jamie Glackin, Lamont accused ""senior members of the party"" of questioning her role and said that she was taking herself ""out of the equation"" to allow Scottish Labour to have a discussion about the best way forward.[146] Anas Sarwar became Labour's acting leader. On 26 October, following a meeting of the party's executive committee, he outlined the details of a leadership election, which would be held using the three-tier electoral college, and conclude with the announcement of a new leader on 13 December.[147] Murphy, Boyack and Neil Findlay stood in the subsequent contest, with Murphy elected as Lamont's successor.[148] Lamont did not vote for Murphy in the election, but instead chose to back his rivals.[149]Miliband paid tribute to Lamont shortly after she announced that she intended to relinquish the leadership role, saying she had ""led the Scottish Labour Party with determination"".[150] McLeish and McConnell both indicated that Lamont's sudden departure following weeks of speculation could have implications for Miliband's leadership. McLeish said that Miliband's chance of becoming Prime Minister could be affected if Labour returned fewer Scottish MPs in 2015, something he called a problem of ""historic, epic proportions"",[141] while McConnell said that he was ""very, very angry"" and suggested Miliband had questions to answer about the circumstances surrounding the resignation.[141] Salmond echoed the views of his predecessor, arguing that Miliband ""should be answering questions about why Labour in Scotland is run as an extension of his Westminster office, and why he has effectively forced the resignation of a Labour leader in Scotland.""[151]Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, rejected Lamont's claims about UK Labour's treatment of its Scottish counterpart.[152] Ian Davidson claimed that supporters of Murphy, who subsequently announced his intention to stand in the leadership contest to succeed Lamont, had conducted a whispering campaign against her. He further suggested that those on the right of the party had resented her election as leader and ignored her, treating her as a ""wee lassie"".[153]
Post leadership[edit]
Lamont during General Questions at the Scottish Parliament in March 2020Labour went on to suffer significant losses, both in the 2015 UK general election, and the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. In Glasgow, where the party had traditionally enjoyed strong support, both elections produced a result in which every Labour held constituency was lost to the SNP, while in 2016 the Conservatives overtook Labour as the second largest party at Holyrood. Lamont lost her Glasgow Pollok seat to the SNP's Humza Yousaf, who secured it with a majority of 6,484, but she was one of four Labour candidates elected to the Glasgow regional list, where she was joined by Sarwar, James Kelly and Pauline McNeill. In response to the results, Lamont suggested Labour needed to understand the reasons behind it, and suggested that the 2014 referendum could be partially responsible. ""A bit of it, I think, is still the referendum, the Yes/No is the divide in people’s minds rather than the politics of taxation, investing in public services against a low tax economy and so on.""[154][155]In November 2016, Lamont was announced as a member of the Commission on Parliamentary Reform, having been nominated to represent Scottish Labour.[156]In May 2018, Lamont was selected as Scottish Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for the Glasgow South UK Parliament constituency. In the 2017 general election, the constituency had been held by the SNP's Stewart McDonald with a majority of just 2,027. She contested the seat at the snap general election in December 2019 but was defeated by McDonald, whose majority increased to 9,005 over Labour.[157][158]Lamont nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[159]In 2022, Lamont was named as a founding member of the Board of Directors of Beira's Place, a Scotland-based private support service for female victims of sexual violence.[160]
Politics and views[edit]
Although she has been criticised by SNP politicians for taking a ""Blairite"" stance on public services, The Guardian's Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as ""rooted to older [Labour] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness"".[10] Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching.[3][161] Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference:[161] ""I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times of trying to make a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where my mother always reminded me that what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that.""[161][162]Lamont played a prominent role in the Better Together campaign that successfully persuaded Scots to vote to keep the Union in 2014. Speaking to the Labour party conference in 2013, she said: ""The politics of identity is not the politics of justice. It wasn’t Scots, or the English or the Welsh or the Irish who fought for women’s votes, it was women and men who believed in justice... And I believe that Scotland is too big a country to hide behind Hadrian’s Wall and not play our part in fighting injustice in all its forms throughout these islands, and through partnership with our friends and neighbours across the world.""[163]Throughout her career, Lamont has campaigned on issues such as equality and violence against women.[6][45][164] Her profile on the Scottish Parliament website lists her political interests as being focussed on tackling poverty, women's rights and disability issues.[5] She credits Curran, and the work of author Erin Pizzey for helping to broaden her understanding of women's issues.[4] On 12 March 2014, she led a Scottish Parliament debate in which she discussed the increased opportunities available for women in Scotland, whilst highlighting issues she felt still needed to be addressed.[165] At First Minister's Questions, she often highlighted personal stories of members of the public, believing them to bring an element of real life into the Parliament.[3] Along with Holyrood's other opposition leaders, Lamont signed the Equality Network's Equal Marriage Pledge in favour of legalising same-sex marriage in January 2012,[166] and voted in favour of the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill on 4 February 2014.[167] As someone with a Gaelic background, she has spoken of her belief in the importance of providing support for the language, feeling it has an economic benefit for Scotland.[24] On the death of 95-year-old Nelson Mandela in December 2013, Lamont joined other public figures in paying tribute to him, describing the former South African President as ""the towering figure of my life since I became politically aware"".[168]Lamont has said that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament election because the party lost its direction,[50] and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster.[169] In February 2012, she told the Times Educational Supplement, ""We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country – it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics.""[11] She told delegates at the 2012 Scottish Labour Party conference that it was time for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. ""We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But now, we need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs.""[96]In an interview with Scotland on Sunday in September 2013, Lamont signalled her support for the creation of a land tax as part of reforms to local taxation, suggesting that the council tax freeze introduced by the SNP had resulted in a funding shortfall.[170] At the 2014 Scottish Trades Union Congress annual conference, Lamont outlined plans to establish a Workers' Charter, saying she would work with the SNP government to achieve this.[171]Lamont is a signatory of the Labour Women’s Declaration, which originated amongst Labour members but is not affiliated with it. The declaration, which has been criticised as transphobic by some Labour members, opposes reform of the Gender Recognition Act which would allow transgender people to obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate on the basis of a statutory declaration, rather than the existing Gender Recognition Panel system.[172] In the Scottish Parliament, the Labour Women’s Group, of which Lamont is a member, opposes protections for trans people being included in the Scottish Government’s Hate Crime bill, saying: ""Cross-dressing is at best a fashion statement, and at worst the public enactment of a male fetish to wear women’s clothing, particularly lingerie. We do not think it should be protected in law.""[173]
Media image[edit]
After her inaugural session of First Minister's Questions on 22 December 2011, the BBC's Brian Taylor called Lamont's performance ""confident, direct and salient"".[61] Cochrane has suggested that she emerged as the prevailing force at the weekly debates with Salmond, writing in May 2013, ""it's been obvious for some time to those of us in the cheap seats that Johann Lamont has more than got his measure.""[174] Peter Hetherington of The Guardian quotes an unnamed political observer at Holyrood who said, ""She's getting under [Salmond's] skin like no predecessor.""[10] Writing for The Scotsman as Scottish Labour gathered for its conference in April 2013, Andrew Whitaker felt that Lamont's tenure as party leader had been successful, citing Labour's local election achievements and her weekly exchanges with Salmond at First Minister's Questions as examples: ""Ms Lamont has made Labour at Holyrood respectable again and less of the laughing stock than the ravaged party that emerged from heavy defeat in 2011.""[175]Her media appearances were criticised for their awkwardness. In September 2012, Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she ""fluffed her lines"" during an interview with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour's public service policy review.[122] Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, in which she was repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as ""articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; she ought to be applauded for it, but the trouble is we live in a sound-bite age.""[3] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, ""despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [Lamont] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating.""[6] The BBC's Marianne Taylor describes Lamont as ""Quietly spoken and more humorous in person than she comes across on television"".[9]Ian Swanson of The Scotsman has described her as ""dour but passionate"".[176] Lamont's low public recognition indicated by the December 2013 TNS BMRB poll led Herald columnist Alison Rowat to label her ""the invisible woman of the independence debate"", and to suggest she needed to raise her profile.[177] Impressionist Jonathan Watson satirised Lamont in the 2013 edition of BBC Scotland's annual Hogmanay comedy show Only an Excuse?, featuring a sketch in which she debates Scottish independence with Salmond.[178]
Awards[edit]
Lamont's decision to question the status quo over the availability of free public services for all earned her the Political Impact of the Year award at the 2012 Herald Scottish Politician of the Year Awards. She was also nominated for Politician of the Year at the same ceremony, but beaten by Deputy First Minister Sturgeon.[179] At the 2013 awards, she was the winner of the Donald Dewar Debater of the Year award for her weekly exchanges with Salmond at First Minister's Questions.[180]
Personal life[edit]
Lamont is married to Archie Graham, a member of Glasgow City Council as a Labour councillor for Langside ward.[3][181] They have two children.[181] Her nephew, Dòmhnall MacLaomainn, is a journalist with BBC Gàidhlig.[182] She is a fan of the television soap Coronation Street and likes to keep fit by walking, jogging and dancing.[5] As a keen runner, she has completed several long distance races.[183]

Political career[edit]
Finnie developed political awareness while still at High School and joined the SNP at 16 years old.[2] He first stood as a candidate in a 2006 by-election for a Highland Council seat.[2] In 2007 he was elected to representing the Inverness Ness-side ward on Highland Council.[5] He was SNP group leader and an SNP-Independent administration was formed.[6] In June 2008 the coalition split.[7] In November 2010, Finnie wrote to the Lord Advocate, urging her to reinvestigate the case of Willie McRae, who died in 1985.[8]Finnie was elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2011 election.[9] He was parliamentary liaison officer to the Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill.[4]Finnie resigned from the SNP on 23 October 2012 over the party's decision to support NATO membership for an independent Scotland,[10] attending Holyrood as an independent member.

On 5 September 2017, the Scottish Government included support for his proposal in its Programme for Government for 2017–18.[18] The proposed measures became law on 7 November 2019 (Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Act 2019).[19]He announced in 2019 that he would not stand for re-election in 2021.[20]

One of his forebears was a Member of the (original) Parliament of Scotland, for Berwickshire, in 1707 who opposed the Act of Union.
As a delegate to the Labour Party Conference in 1976, Home Robertson moved the resolution which committed the Party to devolution for Scotland, and throughout his career at Westminster he campaigned for the establishment of the Scottish Parliament. Home Robertson was the successful Labour candidate at the Berwick and East Lothian by-election in 1978, following the death of Labour MP John Mackintosh.
He represented Berwick and East Lothian until the 1983 general election, when the constituency was abolished and he was elected for the new constituency of East Lothian. He was re-elected at subsequent general elections before standing down at the 2001 election, when he was replaced by Anne Picking.
A Europhile, Home Robertson was one of only five Labour MPs to vote for the Third Reading of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, defying his party Whip, which was to abstain.[2]At Westminster, Home Robertson served on the Scottish Affairs (1979–83) and Defence (1990–) Select committees, and was Chairman of the Scottish Group of Labour M.P.s, 1982–83. He spent time as Opposition Scottish Whip, 1983–84, as Labour's Opposition Front Bench Spokesman on: Agriculture (1984–87), Scottish Affairs (1987–88), Agricultural and Rural Affairs (1988–), and Food (1989–).[3]He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Jack Cunningham at the Ministry of Agriculture and then at the Cabinet Office. He announced that would stand down from the Scottish Parliament in 2007,[4] and was succeeded by Iain Gray.

Personal detailsBornJohn Robert Lamont (1976-04-15) 15 April 1976 (age 47)Kilwinning, North Ayrshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesAlma materUniversity of GlasgowWebsitewww.johnlamont.orgJohn Robert Lamont (born 15 April 1976) is a Scottish Conservative Party politician and solicitor who has served in the British House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk since 2017. Lamont previously served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, later Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire after boundary changes, from 2007 to 2017. He has been serving as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland since October 2022.[1]
Early life[edit]
John Lamont was born on 15 April 1976 in Kilwinning to Robert and Elizabeth Lamont. He was educated at Kilwinning Academy and studied at the School of Law of the University of Glasgow where he gained a first class honours degree. He worked as a solicitor at Freshfields in London and then at Brodies in Edinburgh.[2]
Political career[edit]
In 2002, Lamont stood as a candidate in the London Borough of Lambeth in the Brixton ward where he finished in 10th place. As well as becoming involved in local politics, he became the Chairman of his local Conservative association and was the Conservative candidate for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk at the 2005, 2010 and 2015 general elections.[2]
Lamont as an MSP in 2011In May 2007, Lamont was elected Member of the Scottish Parliament for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, he won the newly constituted Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire seat with an increased majority. As an MSP, he served as Scottish Conservative Chief Whip and Parliamentary Business Manager.[3] From 1 March to 22 March 2011, Lamont was briefly Convener of the Justice Committee following the resignation of Bill Aitken.[4] He caused controversy in May 2011, for accusing Catholic education in the west of Scotland to be 'state-sponsored conditioning of sectarian attitudes'.[5] Following the resignation of Annabel Goldie as the Scottish Conservative leader, Lamont had been tipped as a potential candidate to replace her, however he reportedly 'self-destructed' his chances following his remarks on Catholic schools.[6] In November 2017, it emerged that Lamont's local party had accepted a £2,000 donation from one of the funders of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a self-proclaimed ""climate sceptic"" organisation.[7]Lamont announced his intention to stand down from this Holyrood seat effective 4 May 2017 to stand at the 2017 snap election for the Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk seat.[8] As a constituency MSP, Lamont's resignation triggered a by-election in the constituency, which was won by Rachael Hamilton of the Scottish Conservatives.[9] In June 2017, he was elected Member of Parliament for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, with a majority of 11,060 votes; which made the constituency the safest Conservative seat in Scotland.[10] He was re-elected to serve as MP at the December 2019 general election, but with a lower vote count of 48.4% and a majority of 5,148.[11]Lamont was given the role of Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Foreign Office in November 2021.[12] He resigned from this position on 6 June 2022 in order to vote against Boris Johnson in the vote of no confidence.[13] He was previously critical of Johnson over the parties in Number 10 during lockdown, saying it was ""sickening"" to read about them.[14]Appointed on 26 October 2022, Lamont is currently a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Scotland Office. [2]
Personal life[edit]
In 2014 he became the first UK politician to complete an Ironman Triathlon and was the fastest MP in the 2018 London Marathon, running to raise funds for MND Scotland and the My Name's Doddie Foundation.[15] He also ran the 2019 London Marathon, raising money for Marie Curie Daffodil Appeal.[16]

Anti-LGBTQ+ rightsAlma materHutchesons' Grammar School
University of GlasgowProfessionAccountantWebsitejohn-mason.orgJohn Fingland Mason (born 15 May 1957) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who has served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Shettleston since 2011.
He was previously the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow East from 2008 to 2010, and a Glasgow City Councillor from 1998 to 2008.
Mason has been involved with charity work, and he is an accountant. He is a practising Christian and believes abortion should not be allowed for social reasons. He has attracted significant controversy for beliefs and comments which critics deemed to be transphobic and homophobic. He also faced significant criticism for keeping his SNP office open to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, and for comments describing the Irish Republican Army as ""freedom fighters"".

Background[edit]
Originally from Rutherglen, Mason has lived in the East End of Glasgow for 20 years. His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother a teacher. After attending Hutchesons' Grammar School,[2] he studied Accounting at the University of Glasgow, becoming an ICAS Chartered Accountant.
He worked for housing associations, nursing homes, and with a charity in London. He also spent three years in Kathmandu, Nepal, with an NGO (United Mission to Nepal) representing churches from across the world.

Councillor[edit]
Mason was elected as the councillor for the Garrowhill ward in Glasgow City Council at a by-election in 1998, and was re-elected in 1999 and 2003.[3]He rose to become the Leader of the Opposition in Glasgow City Council, and led the SNP Council Group on the majority Labour-run Council between 1999 and 2008. He was the SNP's longest-serving Glasgow councillor, and during his term, he led many protests against Labour's moves to weaken effective opposition by altering the council committee system.[3]In his ward, he attended a wide variety of community groups, including Garrowhill and Swinton Community Councils, local school boards, tenants association, and Garrowhill Action Partnership. He was also on the management committee of Tenant Controlled Housing, which aims to give local tenants control of their housing, in place of Glasgow Housing Association (GHA).[4]
Parliamentarian[edit]
Member of Parliament[edit]
On 30 June 2008, David Marshall, Labour MP for Glasgow East, resigned from the UK Parliament on the grounds of ill-health,[5][6] thereby triggering a by-election.[7][8] The decision by Labour to call a quick by-election (set for 24 July 2008) was partly attributed to Labour's troubled finances and fears of an SNP campaign building up enough momentum.[9] John Mason was selected as SNP candidate for Glasgow East on 3 July.[10] During the by-election, the candidate stance on abortion was displayed on noticeboards in catholic churches; Mason was reported to be opposed to abortion occurring for social reasons.[11]Mason won the by-election in a surprise victory, defeating the Labour candidate Margaret Curran, MSP for Glasgow Baillieston.[12][13] He overturned a Labour majority of more than 13,500 to win the seat on a swing of more than 22%. It was Labour's third-safest seat in Scotland.[14]Mason resigned his council seat immediately following his election as MP.[15] Mason served as the SNP's Westminster spokesperson on Work and Pensions during his tenure as an MP.[16] From 2009 until losing his seat in 2010, he also sat on the House of Commons' Select Committee on Administration.[16]In an interview with The Guardian newspaper in April 2010, when questioned about his Protestant religious beliefs, and how that could conflict with the rights of others in the UK, Mason acknowledged the difficulty that this issue raised with him, informing the newspaper that he had been warned to leave this issue alone by his party,[17]Mason was the last MP to ask a spoken question of a Labour Prime Minister, questioning Gordon Brown on a potential inquiry into corruption at Glasgow City Council at Brown's final Prime Minister's Questions on 7 April 2010.[18]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, he won the Glasgow Shettleston constituency with a majority of 586 votes.[19]Journalist and sketchwriter Alex Massie described him as, ""the well-meaning creationist SNP member for Glasgow East... Mr Mason is a Holyrood treasure, a great entertainer in the long tradition of impressively bumbling backbenchers who add to the gaiety of parliamentary proceedings.""[20]
Controversies[edit]
During the debate on same-sex marriage in Scotland, Mason was widely condemned for raising a motion stating that “while some in society approve of same-sex sexual relationships, others do not agree with them” and that no person or organisation should be forced to be involved or to approve of same-sex marriage.[21] In February 2013, he wrote that he did not believe same-sex couples should have sex, on the grounds that, ""the Bible is the word of God and its teachings are God’s direction as to how I should live my life. The Bible’s teaching is that a follower of Jesus should not have a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex.”[22][23] In 2020 Mason returned to the question of gay sex, informing the Scottish Parliament whilst debating the Hate Crime Bill that the legislation would mean, ""[Green party co-leader] Patrick Harvie and I can continue to debate who should or should not have sex with whom... That is a sign of a healthy society and a healthy democracy.""[23] The remark was criticised as ""utterly bizarre"".[23]In January 2015 he spoke in parliament in favour of teaching school children young Earth creationism, claiming that it cannot be ""disproved by science"".[24][25]In February 2016, he publicly asked ""How is national debt different from national deficit?"" on Twitter, prompting The Spectator to say that he ""appears to lack a basic understanding of finance"".[26][27] He was re-elected in 2016.[28]In January 2017, he tweeted in the context of a second independence referendum that ""Girls don't always say yes first time"", leading to criticism that his comments were sexist and trivialised ""rape culture"" by Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Conservatives and the President of NUS Scotland, Vonnie Sandlan. Mason defended his comment as innocent and reflected the fact that ""asking a girl for a relationship or to dinner, they don't always say yes the first time.""[29][30]In February 2017, The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon apologised to the families of three Scottish IRA murder victims after Mason had claimed members of the terrorist organisation could be considered freedom fighters. Mason apologised for his comments after a meeting with the SNP's Scottish Parliament chief whip Bill Kidd.[31][32]In June 2017 Mason tweeted that, “learning times tables and spelling [were] stronger in my day but we have moved on”.[33] He also wrote that, “Of course, reading and writing are very important. But if someone is a good surgeon and cannot spell, is that a problem?” and “What level of literacy is needed to have an IT career?”[20] During a session of First Minister's Questions, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson asked Nicola Sturgeon whether she agreed with Mason; the First Minister declined to endorse his comments.[34][20]In May 2018, Mason was criticised for comparing the child sexual abuse by former Celtic F.C. employees to tax avoidance schemes.  Mason defended his comments.[35]Also in May 2018, Mason was contacted by a wheelchair user with concerns about the lack of accessibility to Celtic football club's stadium.[36] Mason suggested that the fan support another team, a comment described as ""outrageous"" by Labour MSP James Kelly.[37]In June 2018 Mason responded to an email from a constituent that he did not agree with retrospective pardons for gay men convicted of having consensual sex before decriminalisation. He wrote, ""I do not see that we can go round pardoning and apologising for everything that other people did that does not conform to modern customs. Will the Italians be apologising for the Roman occupation?""[38] Mason was criticised for his ""flippant tone"".[38]In November 2018 he wrote a letter to The Herald newspaper to complain that transgender people ""override science"".[22]In September 2019, he tabled a motion called ""Both Lives Matter"", which called for abortion to be restricted.[39]In March 2020, he came under criticism for refusing to follow Scottish Government advice and keeping his parliamentary office open to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.[40] Fergus Mutch, a former SNP press officer, said of the controversy, ""When I ran the SNP press office, I often felt I was defending the indefensible with John Mason. In the past, however, he’s only brought the party into disrepute. This time he’s risking lives. Typically stubborn and deeply arrogant.”[41]In May 2020, he came under fire for proposing a motion that the Scottish Parliament should ""recognise the sacrifices"" the armed forces make, the Parliament should ""believe that some people use Armed Forces' Day to celebrate military might and power for the promotion of what considers to be an unhealthy British nationalism"". Leading to criticism from opposition parties that it was ""deeply disrespectful"" to the armed forces. Mason defending his proposed motion stating: ""I think my motion is clear in that I fully support the armed forces and am happy that we celebrate them.""[42]He was re-elected in 2021 and used his victory speech to pledge that he would work on ""issues around transgender.""[43]In 2021, amid reports of a cleansing and vermin crisis in Glasgow, Labour MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy told Holyrood that there were even rats in her flat.[44] Mason heckled her that, ""There are rats in every street.""[45]In October 2021, Mason received cross-party criticism for attending an anti-abortion protest outside the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, for claiming that abortion services were rarely 'vital' and alleging that some women are 'coerced' into having abortions.[46] In September 2022 it was reported that Mason was disciplined by the SNP for defending the anti-abortion protests and ""causing distress and trauma to women in the way he expressed his views on abortion rights"" [47]In January 2022 Mason referred to trans women as ""people whose biological sex is male"" and suggested that those convicted of crimes should serve their sentences in male prisons. Mason's remark was denounced as a ""very shrill anti-trans dog whistle"".[48]In May 2022, Mason tweeted that abortion clinics ""push abortions without laying out the pros and cons"".[49] In June 2022, Mason told a constituent that he was ""pretty positive"" about the overruling of Roe v. Wade and the end of US-wide abortion rights. In response Scottish Government Minister for Women's Health, Maree Todd MSP wrote, ""For the avoidance of doubt: There is nothing positive about the recent US court ruling. Abortion has been legal in Scotland for over 50 years."" And Scottish Labour Women’s Health spokesperson, Carol Mochan, said: “It is sickening to see an SNP MSP gloating as millions of women losing access to vital healthcare.""[50] Also, in June 2022, Mason described abortion clinics as ""conveyor belts"".[51]In October 2022, Mason was criticised  by Labour MSP Paul Sweeney for his ""insulting"" response to a Glasgow-based homeless charity. Homeless Project Scotland had contacted Mason among several politicians looking for support for a safe indoor space to aid them during the winter months, Mason instead criticised the charity’s finances and asked them to ""rent a building"" instead of seeking assistance from local government, the charity accused Mason of continuing to ""blast our charity"" and claimed Mason had never responded to requests to visit them.[52]In March 2023, Mason was accused of 'hijacking' plans for a Scottish baby loss memorial book to further his anti-abortion agenda. He had tabled a motion in parliament welcoming the proposal but called for ""more equality for all unborn babies in the future” and compared miscarriage and premature death to abortion. Labour's Monica Lennon said Mr Mason was trying to ""undermine abortion rights."" Lennon said “Anti-choice campaigners will take every opportunity to undermine abortion rights, and this parliamentary motion from the SNP’s John Mason is the latest example.[53]In April 2023, Mason was spotted at an SPUC anti-abortion protest in Edinburgh. Lucy Grieve, co-founder of Back Off Scotland said it was “completely inappropriate” that Mason retains the SNP party whip.[54] Mason was interviewed by SPUC at the protest and appeared to admit to having attended another anti-abortion protest in Glasgow ""I would have to say I also visited outside the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, I was at the pro-life vigil during the 40 days, and yet again, very quiet, very peaceful. So the idea that we need legislation to restrict demonstrations like this or vigils like this is jus absolute nonsense"".[55] The legislation Mason is referring to is Gillian Mackay's private members bill to introduce safe access zones around hospitals and clinics providing abortion services

Personal life[edit]
Mason is single, a member of Easterhouse Baptist Church and a Clyde F.C. supporter.[56]

Personal detailsBorn (1948-02-13) 13 February 1948 (age 75)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partySSP (since 2006)Other politicalaffiliationsSLP (1970s)Labour (1982–2006)John McAllion (born 13 February 1948) is a campaigner for the Scottish Socialist Party, as well as a former Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), and convenor of Tayside Regional Council. He is also convener of the Scottish Fairtrade Forum.[1]
Early life[edit]
McAllion was born in Glasgow, where he was educated at St Augustine's RC Comprehensive School in Milton. Following a brief period spent working as a clerical employee for the Post Office, he was admitted to the University of St Andrews to study modern and medieval history, graduating with a second-class honours degree in 1972.[2] After a further year at Dundee College of Education, he was then employed by the city's education department to teach history at St Saviour's RC High School (1973–78) and social studies at Balgowan School (1978–82).[2]
Political history[edit]
McAllion was originally a member of the Scottish Labour Party (SLP) that was formed in 1976 by Jim Sillars; when the SLP collapsed, he chose to join the Labour Party (unlike Sillars, who joined the Scottish National Party). In 1982 he was recruited by the Glasgow Labour MP Bob McTaggart as a research assistant. Two years later, he was elected to Tayside Regional Council, becoming the council's convenor in 1986. At the 1987 general election McAllion was elected as the Labour MP for Dundee East, defeating SNP leader Gordon Wilson, who had been the sitting MP since February 1974.
McAllion was a member of Scottish Labour Action, putting him on the Scottish nationalist wing of the Labour Party, and of the Campaign for Socialism, placing him firmly on the left of the party. As befitted a member of the Scottish Labour Action group he strongly favoured home rule for Scotland, and was often outspoken in his defence of civic-minded Scottish nationalism. In 1999 he was elected to the Scottish Parliament to represent Dundee East.
As an MSP, he furthered his reputation as a left-winger, rebelling several times against the Labour-led Scottish Executive. He was also convenor of the Scottish Parliament's Petitions Committee. In 2000 he helped establish the Scottish Left Review publication.  At the 2003 parliament election he lost his seat to Shona Robison, the SNP candidate. The Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) pulled out of contesting the seat in favour of McAllion, but ironically this may have assisted his defeat.[citation needed]After the election defeat, McAllion resigned his membership of the Labour Party, subsequently joining the Scottish Socialist Party. On 9 February 2006, McAllion stood for the SSP in the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, coming fifth of nine candidates with 1.6% of the vote.[3][4]He was elected to the SSP executive at its conference in March 2006. He was elected co-chair (along with Morag Balfour) at its conference in October 2007, but he stood down during his term of office for personal reasons. However, he has remained active in campaigning with the party, particularly in the run-up to the independence referendum.

Personal detailsBorn (1951-06-07) 7 June 1951 (age 72)Girvan, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesWilliam John Graham Scott OBE (born 7 June 1951) is a Scottish farmer and former Scottish Conservative politician. He was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Ayr from 2000 to 2021.

Background[edit]
Born in Girvan, Scott was educated at Barrhill Primary in South Ayrshire and George Watson's College in Edinburgh. He has a Bachelor of Science degree for Civil Engineering from the University of Edinburgh[citation needed].
Scott played for the Wigtownshire Rugby Club from 1969 to 1973, a hobby he enjoys to this day[citation needed].
Scott established the Ayrshire Farmers Market in 1999 and founded the Scottish Association for Farmers in 2001[citation needed]. He tends to his farm in Balkissock outside of Ballantrae in South Ayrshire, whilst also owning a flat in the town of Ayr.[1]
Political career[edit]
Scott stood as the Conservative candidate for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, finishing third behind Labour and the Scottish National Party with 8,123 votes (19.8%). He has served as constituency MSP for Ayr since winning the constituency in a by-election in 2000.  He was returned to Parliament at the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary election and again, with an increased majority, at the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary election. At the 2011 and 2016 elections he retained the constituency with a reduced majority, despite seeing his vote increase by 3,564 between 2007 and 2016.
Scott declared his support for Ruth Davidson in the Scottish Conservative leader election.[2] On 11 May 2011, he was elected by MSPs to serve as one of the two Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament.[3] He served until 2016 when he was unsuccessful in his attempt to become Presiding Officer.
Scott was the Scottish Conservative spokesperson for sustainable development between 2016 and 2021, having previously served as spokesperson for the environment from 2001 until 2003 and as spokesperson on rural affairs from 2007 until 2011.[4] He was appointed as the convener of the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee of the Scottish Parliament in June 2016.[5] In 2021, he lost his seat to the Scottish National Party's Siobhian Brown.[6]Scott was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for political and public service.[7][8]
Controversy[edit]
Scott came under fire after it emerged that he profited from wind energy investments – despite his party having previously opposed the development of such projects. The Register of Interests for Mr Scott states: ""From 6 March 2009 part of the Farm’s income comes from a contract with CRE Energy Ltd to provide access over the farm for the purpose of building and maintaining a windfarm"".[9]

Elizabeth Quigley ​(m. 2003)​
Children3RelativesTom Hunter (uncle)Alma materUniversity of EdinburghWebsiteOfficial websiteJohn Ramsay Swinney (born 13 April 1964) is a Scottish politician who served as Deputy First Minister of Scotland from 2014 to 2023. He held various Scottish Cabinet roles under First Ministers Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon from 2007 to 2023. Swinney has  served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Perthshire North since 2011, having previously represented North Tayside from 1999 to 2011. He was the Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2000 to 2004.
Born in Edinburgh, Swinney graduated with a MA in politics at the University of Edinburgh. He joined the SNP at a young age and quickly rose to prominence serving as the National Secretary from 1986 to 1992 and Depute Leader of the SNP from 1998 to 2000. Swinney served in the British House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Tayside North from 1997 to 2001. He was elected to the inaugural Scottish Parliament in 1999. After Alex Salmond resigned the party leadership in 2000, Swinney was elected Leader of the Scottish National Party in the ensuing leadership contest. He became Leader of the Opposition in the Scottish Parliament. Swinney's leadership proved ineffectual, with a loss of one MP in 2001 and a further reduction to 27 MSPs in 2003 despite the Officegate scandal unseating previous First Minister Henry McLeish. However, the only parties to gain seats in that election were the Scottish Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) which, like the SNP, support independence. After an unsuccessful leadership challenge in 2003, Swinney stepped down following disappointing results in the 2004 European Parliament election with Salmond returning to the role in the subsequent 2004 leadership contest.
From 2004 to 2007, Swinney sat in the SNP's opposition backbench. In the 2007 Scottish election, the SNP won the highest number of seats in the Scottish Parliament and Salmond was subsequently appointed First Minister of Scotland. Swinney served under Salmond as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth from 2007 to 2014. After Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Salmond, she appointed Swinney as Deputy First Minister of Scotland in 2014. He also served as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Constitution and Economy, until that role was divided into two posts in the second Sturgeon government as a result of the expansion of the Scottish Parliament's financial powers; he was then appointed Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills in 2016, and then as Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery in 2021. On 25 May 2022, Swinney became the longest serving Deputy First Minister, surpassing the previous record which was held by Sturgeon. Swinney served as Acting Finance Secretary in addition to his position of Covid Recovery Secretary from July 2022 to March 2023, covering the duties of Kate Forbes during her period of maternity leave. In March 2023, Swinney announced his resignation as Deputy First Minister in response to Nicola Sturgeon's resignation as First Minister.

Early life[edit]
Family, education and early career[edit]
John Ramsay Swinney was born on 13 April 1964[1] in the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, the son of Kenneth Swinney, a garage manager,[2] and Agnes Weir Swinney (née Hunter).[3] His uncle Tom Hunter was awarded the Victoria Cross whilst serving with the Royal Marines during the Second World War.[4] His maternal grandparents, Ramsey and Mary Hunter, were from England, having moved to Edinburgh in the 1920s.[5][6]He was educated at Forrester High School, before attending the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with an Master of Arts Honours degree in politics in 1986.[7] Swinney was a research officer for the Scottish Coal Project from 1987 to 1988, a senior management consultant with Development Options from 1988 to 1992, and a strategic planning principal with Scottish Amicable Building Society from 1992 to 1997.[8]
Early political involvement[edit]
Swinney joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1979 at the age of 15,[9] citing his anger at the way in which Scotland had been portrayed by television commentators at the Commonwealth Games.[10] He quickly became a prominent figure in the party's youth wing, the Young Scottish Nationalist, now known as the Young Scots for Independence (YSI).[11] He served as the SNP's Assistant National Secretary, before becoming the National Secretary in 1986, at the age of 22.[12]He served as the national secretary until 1992, then vice convenor, later senior vice-convenor (deputy leader) from 1992 to 1997. At the time of the 1990 leadership contest he supported Margaret Ewing in her bid to become SNP leader, but this did not stop him becoming politically close to the man who went on to win that contest, Alex Salmond.[citation needed]
Early political career[edit]
House of Commons[edit]
At the 1997 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Tayside North constituency,[13] and in 1999 he was elected to represent the same area at the Scottish Parliament.
He stood down as a Westminster MP at the 2001 general election in order to avoid splitting his time, in line with all of his colleagues who found themselves in a similar 'dual mandate' position.

Election to Holyrood[edit]
In 1999, Swinney was elected to the 1st Scottish Parliament, representing the North Tayside constituency.[14] In Salmond's opposition cabinet, he served as the Spokesman on Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. He also served on the Parliament's Finance Committee and was the Convener of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee.[15]
Leadership of the Scottish National Party (2000–2004)[edit]
Leadership bid[edit]
Main article: 2000 Scottish National Party leadership election
In 2000, Alex Salmond resigned as leader of the SNP,[16][17] which triggered a leadership contest.[18][19] Swinney ran in the election against Alex Neil.[20][21] The leadership contest was dominated by internal fights in the party between Gradualists, who advocated Scottish devolution as step towards independence, and Fundamentalists, who were  suspicious of devolution and supported a more radical approach.[22][23] Swinney represented the gradualist wing and Neil represented the fundamentalists wing.[24][25] Whilst both candidates supported the position of the SNP on the centre-left, Neil was seen as the more left-wing of the two, and individuals associated with the Neil campaign argued that a Swinney leadership would drag the SNP to the right.[26][27][28]Swinney won an overwhelming majority of votes by party delegates, securing 67.1% of votes.[29] He was appointed leader at the party's conference on 16 September 2000. Roseanna Cunningham, who endorsed Swinney in the leadership race, was elected Depute Leader.[30][31][32]
Tenure[edit]
Internal party divisions[edit]
Swinney's leadership quickly came under challenge. His subdued style of debating technique was often contrasted with that of his more charismatic predecessor.[33] In 2002, Dorothy-Grace Elder, the SNP MSP for the Glasgow region, resigned her party membership after coming dissatisfied with the leadership of the SNP. She sat as an independent MSP, but Swinney called for her resignation, describing her actions as a ""flout [of] the democratic will of the people of Glasgow"".[34]Margo MacDonald, a fundamentalist within the SNP, voiced her lack of confidence in Swinney's leadership. MacDonald was placed fifth in the Lothians region for the 2003 Parliament election in the SNP's candidate selection, effectively ending her chances of being re-elected as an SNP MSP.[35] In protest, she ran instead as an independent candidate and was later expelled from the party.[36]In 2003, a former parliamentary candidate and a party activist in the Shetland Islands Brian Nugent announced that he was forming his own pro-independence party, the Scottish Party, which eventually relaunched itself as the Free Scotland Party, in response to what he perceived to be an overly pro-EU stance by the SNP.[37][38]
2001 UK and 2003 Scottish elections[edit]

Swinney speaking in a Scottish Parliament debate, June 2000Swinney led the SNP through a poor election result at the 2001 UK General election.[39] The party failed to take any of their target seats and saw the loss of one of their MPs, reducing their representation at Westminster from six to five. In the Perth constituency, the Scottish Conservatives were 50 votes behind the SNP.[40][41] Although the SNP's vote share remained the second-largest party, behind Labour, their vote share fell by 2%.[42] Swinney's predecessor, Salmond, stated ""consolidating as the second party in Scotland is no mean achievement"" and highlighted it put the SNP in a good position for the upcoming Scottish Parliament election in 2003.[43] Following the results of the election, Swinney admitted there were ""lessons to learn"" and ensured the SNP would be the ""principal opposition party in Scottish politics"".[44]In the 2003 election, the SNP performed poorly in yet another election, with the party's vote share dropping by 4.9%.[45] They lost eight of their seats they had gained in the previous election under the leadership of Salmond. Despite a poor result, this was also mirrored by the Scottish Labour Party, who lost six MSPs and their vote share dropped by 4.2%.[46] The SNP remained the second-largest party at Holyrood. The decline in support for the SNP was viewed by some as a rejection of the case for Scottish independence, however, the only parties which increased their representation in that election were the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and the Scottish Green Party, both of which also support independence.[47][48]
2003 leadership challenge[edit]
Main article: 2003 Scottish National Party leadership election
Following the results of the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Bill Wilson, a party activist, became convinced that a change of direction was needed by the SNP leadership.[49] After discussing this with various SNP members, he was persuaded to contest the leadership himself and launched a challenge against Swinney.[50] Wilson ran a campaign attacking Swinney's proposals for party reform, which he claimed would centralise power and impoverish local branches. Wilson also challenged Swinney to a series of debates, although Swinney refused to take part.[51][52]The election was yet another fight between the party's fundamentalists and gradualists, with Wilson attacking Swinney's proposal for a referendum on independence before pursuing negotiations with the British government. Wilson argued that as soon as the SNP can form a government it should pursue negotiations to end the union. Cunningham called Wilson was a ""stalking horse"" candidate put forward to ""weaken and damage"" the leadership.[53]The election was held at the party's 69th annual conference, and saw Swinney winning a massive victory over Wilson.[54] Moves in support of Wilson's proposition of pursuing independence negotiations without a referendum were thrown out at the party conference, and Swinney won significant policy battles over imposing a monthly levy on party MP's, MSP's, and MEP's. In a surprise result, the new central membership system was also approved.[55] The membership changes had been a key issue of attack from Wilson.[53] Soon afterwards, the party's National Executive Committee decided to suspend and then expel Campbell Martin. He had backed Wilson's leadership challenge and had continued to be overtly critical of Swinney's leadership, resulting in disciplinary action.[56] This was the last SNP election to use the delegate voting method. Future elections would be based on a one-person-one-vote postal vote system.[57]
Scottish independence[edit]
In September 2003 he urged SNP activists to ask the public, ""Do you want independence, yes or no? And then tell the Brits to get off."" A spokesman for Scottish Labour condemned the Swinney's use of language and said, ""There is no place in Scotland for his brand of extreme nationalism.""[58]
2004 European Parliament elections[edit]
Though retaining its two seats at the 2004 European elections, in a smaller field of 7 (Scotland up until then had 8 MEPs) the Scottish press and certain elements within the fundamentalist wing of the Party depicted the result as a disaster for the SNP putting further pressure on Swinney to resign.[59][60]
Resignation[edit]
After the results of the 2004 European Parliament election, senior figures within the SNP began privately briefing against Swinney. Gil Paterson, a former MSP for Central Scotland, was the first to call for Swinney's departure, with Michael Russell, a former potential campaign manager for Swinney calling for a change in approach from the SNP.[61] Members of the SNP shadow cabinet began privately discussing removing Swinney from the leadership, and Alex Salmond advised Swinney to resign in exchange for senior party figures not calling openly for his resignation.[62] On 22 June 2004, Swinney resigned as leader of the Scottish National Party, triggering a leadership contest.[63][64][65] He was succeeded by Alex Salmond after winning more than 75% of votes against Roseanna Cunningham and Michael Russell on a joint leadership ticket with Nicola Sturgeon.[66][67][68]
SNP in opposition (2004–2007)[edit]
From 2004 until the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Swinney sat on the SNP's opposition backbenches. He served as a convener on the Parliament's European and External Relations Committee from 2004 to 2005 and deputy convener on the Finance Committee from 2005 to 2007.  Swinney was a substitute member of the Audit Committee from 2004 to 2007.[69] In September 2005, Swinney was made Shadow Minister for Finance.[70][71]
Salmond administration (2007–2014)[edit]
Finance Secretary: 2007–2016[edit]
Swinney (far-left) with members of the first cabinet of Alex Salmond, June 2007In the 2007 election to the 3rd Scottish Parliament, the SNP emerged as the largest party, with one seat more than the governing Scottish Labour.[72][73] Initially the SNP proposed coalition talks with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, however, they declined and instead Swinney led coalition talks with the Scottish Greens.[74] After an agreement, Salmond was appointed first minister of Scotland and he appointed Swinney as the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth in his first minority government.[75]As response to Swinney not notifying the Scottish Parliament that he had let the Scottish Variable Rate lapse due to not funding this tax mechanism, the Scottish Parliament voted to censure him and called his actions ""an abuse of power"".[76] Subsequently, a freedom of information request showed that even if Swinney had funded the mechanism, problems and delays in the HM Revenue & Customs computer system made any collection of the tax impossible. The Scottish Government added, ""The power has not lapsed, the HMRC simply does not have an IT system capable of delivering a ten-month state of readiness.""[77][78]
2008 financial crisis[edit]
Further information: 2008 financial crisis
As Finance Secretary, Swinney was faced with the 2008 financial crash, which resulted in the Scottish economy entering recession.[79]
Deputy First Minister of Scotland (2014-2023)[edit]
Swinney with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after his appointment as Deputy First Minister, November 2014Following the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign in the 2014 referendum, Salmond resigned as leader of the SNP and Swinney was seen as a likely candidate in the leadership race, however, he ""unreservedly"" ruled himself out for a second bid as leader and endorsed Nicola Sturgeon.[80][81][82] Sturgeon was elected unopposed as leader and was subsequently appointed First Minister of Scotland.[83][84] On 21 November 2014, Sturgeon appointed Swinney as Deputy First Minister.[85] He remained as Finance Secretary in Sturgeon's new cabinet.[86][87]
Sturgeon and Swinney head the first meeting of the Scottish Cabinet, May 2016Education Secretary: 2016–2021[edit]
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP lost its overall majority, but remained the largest party with Sturgeon securing a second term as first minister.[88][89] She reappointed Swinney as deputy first minister, and for the first time in nine years, he was reshuffled from his roles as Finance Secretary to Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills.[90][91]
Educational performance[edit]
After the 2017 General Election saw the SNP lose 21 seats, pollster Professor John Curtice told the BBC that the party's record on education had likely dented its popularity: ""The SNP may want to reflect that their domestic record, not least on schools, is beginning to undermine their support among those who on the constitutional question are still willing to support the Nationalist position.""[92]In March 2020, after the results of Scottish students dropped in maths and science in the international PISA rankings for education, Swinney admitted, ""There is progress to be made in maths and science.""[93] Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: ""These two areas are so critical to the success of much of Scotland's modern economy. We should be doing so much better.""[94]
2020 SQA exam controversy[edit]
In August 2020 he was subject to a vote of no confidence in Parliament, with the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all accusing Swinney of creating an exam results system which ""unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed so well"".[95] During the No Confidence debate, Nicola Sturgeon described him as ""one of the most decent and dedicated people in Scottish politics"", while The Herald newspaper reported that: ""Mr Swinney endured a deeply uncomfortable hour in the Holyrood chamber, as opposition MSPs said he had been a serial failure at the education portfolio, and he knew it.""[96] The motion was defeated by 67 votes to 58 resulting in Swinney surviving the vote and remaining as Scottish Education Secretary.[97][98]
Vote of no confidence[edit]
In March 2021 Swinney was the subject of a second motion of no confidence.[99] As the minister in charge of liaising with the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints, Swinney twice refused to publish legal advice requested by the committee.[100][better source needed] After two votes in Parliament failed to persuade him to publish the advice, opposition parties announced a motion of no confidence in him.[100] Swinney u-turned and published the advice; the Scottish Greens declared they would not support the motion of no confidence and it was defeated by 65 votes to 57.[100]
Attainment gap[edit]
A report by Audit Scotland in March 2021 concluded that the results of Swinney's efforts to reduce the poverty related attainment gap in Scottish education were ""limited and [fell] short of the Scottish Government’s aims. Improvement needs to happen more quickly and there needs to be greater consistency across the country."" In 10 Scottish council areas the attainment gap between the richest and the poorest children increased.[101]
Covid Recovery Secretary: 2021–2023[edit]
Following the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Scottish Labour urged Sturgeon to replace Swinney as Cabinet Secretary for Education, citing what it called ""a litany of failures"", in the ""hope a new minister can stop the rot.""[102] On 18 May, Sturgeon announced John Swinney would continue as Deputy First Minister but would be reshuffled to the new cabinet role as Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery.[103]Following the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon, Swinney announced on 2 March 2023 that he was standing down from his position as Deputy First Minister. He stated that it had been an ""honour to serve Scotland"".[104]
Political positions[edit]
Monarchy[edit]
In September 2022, he stated that the monarch should remain head of state of an independent Scotland.[105]
Personal life[edit]
Swinney was married to Lorna King from 1991 to 1998. They had two children: Judith and Stuart. The couple divorced in 1998 after the Daily Record revealed King had an affair with a married nursery teacher.[106] In 2003, he married Elizabeth Quigley, a BBC Scotland News reporter.[107] In 2010, she gave birth to Swinney's third child, Matthew.[108][109] They live in Blairgowrie in Perth and Kinross.[110]

Personal detailsBornKaren Adam (1975-06-07) 7 June 1975 (age 48)[1]Aberdeen, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyChildren6ResidenceAberdeenshireKaren Adam (born 7 June 1975) is a Scottish politician who has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Banffshire and Buchan Coast since 2021.[2] A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she was previously a councillor for the Mid-Formartine ward of Aberdeenshire from 2017 until her election as an MSP in May 2021.[3]
Early life[edit]
Karen Adam was born on 7 June 1975 in Aberdeen. She was raised in a same-sex household, with her mother and her partner.[4][5] As a child, she learned British Sign Language as a way to communicate with her deaf father. Adam became a mother as a teenager and she volunteered in her community.[6]
Political career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Adam joined the Scottish National Party in 2014, with her parents who have been members of the party since the 1960s. She was elected as councillor for the Mid-Formartine ward in the Aberdeenshire Council in the 2017 Scottish local elections. As a councillor, she worked to update the council's plans for the disabled, such as the sign language plan and autism strategy.[7][1][8]Adam preparing to swear in as an MSP, May 2021Election to Holyrood[edit]
In November 2020, she was announced as the SNP's candidate for the Banffshire and Buchan Coast constituency for the 2021 Scottish election, succeeding five-term holder Stewart Stevenson. She was elected to serve as the MSP for the constituency, though the SNP's lead dropped from 23% to 2.3% (772 votes).[9] On the day she was sworn in, Adam was the first ever MSP to take the oath of affirmation in British Sign Language.[10]
Death threat[edit]
In November 2020, Adam became subject to a death threat on social media. On Twitter, she posted an upcoming event that was happening in Aberdeenshire, when she received a reply which said ""I want to shoot you in the head. You are not serious."" Adam originally thought the reply was made by a bot account, until she found out it was a real person.[11]Police made a visit to her property and they insisted she installed CCTV in her home. Adam's phone number was placed on the police's log list, meaning if she calls them, she will receive an answer urgently. The account was reported to the police and has been suspended by Twitter.[11]
Backbencher[edit]
Adam is a member of the Scottish Parliament's Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee and the Rural Affairs, Islands and Natural Environment Committee.[12]In January 2022, Adam responded to Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction for sexual abuse by tweeting: ""Paedophiles and predators are people. Not bogey men under the bed. Not Mac wearing flashers in the street, faceless and nameless. They are our family, friends and colleagues. They are not scary monsters. They are people who abuse. It's uncomfortable to humanise them because we then have to face the horrors in plain sight."" Alba Party general secretary Christopher McEleny interpreted this as an attempt to humanise child abusers, which Adam firmly rejected.[13] She was sent death threats and Police Scotland later launched an investigation.[14] She later told The Guardian: ""It started to dawn on me that this was not accidental, that people were perhaps purposely misrepresenting my words. [They were] purposely misrepresenting my words for political gain and to support political movements. I've seen this before. The more open I am about my progressive views, the more I am called a pervert, or a predator enabler, for supporting trans rights, for supporting LGBT rights overall.""[15]Adam condemned what she called a ""malcious, creepy attempt"" to silence her in December 2022 during a GRA reform debate.[16] In April 2023 a police probe found that the incident was the result of an innocent mix-up at an Edinburgh salon. A woman with a similar name to Adam had tried to make a genuine appointment and the MSP got the confirmation email, in what police sources confirmed was an “administrative error"".[17]
Personal life[edit]
Adam lives in Aberdeenshire with her five sons. She is grandmother to her oldest and only daughter's children.[4] She is a carer to her deaf father and has six children, some with special needs.[1] She had her first child as a teenager and married the child's father, but later divorced him due to spousal abuse. After the divorce, she became a Mormon for 20 years, but left the church after divorcing her second husband and father of the rest of her children, who was having an affair.[4]

Personal detailsBorn (1970-01-08) 8 January 1970 (age 54)Bellshill, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourKaren Whitefield (born 8 January 1970, Bellshill) is a Scottish Labour politician.  She was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Airdrie and Shotts constituency from 1999 to 2011.

Political career[edit]
Prior to her election as MSP, she worked as a personal assistant to Rachel Squire MP.

MSP for Airdrie and Shotts: 1999–2011[edit]
She was elected as MSP for Airdrie and Shotts at the 1999 Scottish Parliament general election. As an MSP, she chaired the Parliament's Education Committee, where she used her casting vote to reject the student graduate endowment bill, a Scottish National Party (SNP) flagship policy. It had the backing of the Liberal Democrats and SNP members, but not the Labour or Conservative members of the committee.[1] The bill was eventually passed through the Scottish Parliament by a vote of 67 to 61. Whitefield was Scottish Labour's shadow Minister for Children in the Scottish Parliament, and Convener of the Cross-Party Group on Diabetes under Iain Gray. At the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, she lost her seat to the SNP's Alex Neil, one of nine Labour MSPs to lose their constituency seats after holding them since the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in 1999.[2]
Falkirk PPC: 2015[edit]
Following the resignation of sitting MP Eric Joyce (and the controversial and flawed 2013 Labour Party Falkirk candidate selection), in a re-run in which all the previous candidates were excluded on 8 December 2013, Whitefield was selected to contest the Falkirk constituency at the 2015 UK general election.[3] In the event, the SNP landslide swept Scotland, including Falkirk, and Whitehead was unsuccessful in being elected.

Labour Leadership 2021 campaign[edit]
Following the resignation of Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, Whitefield chaired Anas Sarwar's leadership campaign.  Sarwar was subsequently voted in as leader of Scottish Labour.[4]
Personal life[edit]
After her unseating in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, she subsequently became a campaign officer at USDAW.  She is single and lives in the village of Glenmavis - a satellite village of Airdrie.[citation needed]

   ​ ​(m2021)​Children1Alma materSelwyn College, Cambridge (BA)University of Edinburgh (MSc)SignatureWebsitekate-forbes.scotKate Elizabeth Forbes (born 6 April 1990) is a Scottish politician. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency since the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. She also served as the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy from 2020 to 2023.[a][b]Born in Dingwall, Scotland, in 1990, Forbes was raised in India and Scotland and was educated at a Scottish Gaelic school, where she became fluent in the language. She earned a BA degree in history at Selwyn College, Cambridge, and then an MSc in diaspora and migration history from the University of Edinburgh. After completing her degree, Forbes worked for a short time in the Scottish Parliament as a researcher for SNP MSP Dave Thompson. Forbes was elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election and quickly rose within the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon appointed Forbes as the Minister for Public Finance, Planning and Community Wealth, serving as the deputy to the Scottish Finance Secretary, Derek Mackay. After Mackay resigned, Forbes was appointed Finance Secretary by Sturgeon. Her tenure was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland, and its economic impact, and the cost of living crisis in the UK. 
On announcement of Sturgeon's intention to resign as Leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland, Forbes announced her candidacy for leader in the 2023 SNP leadership election, but lost to Humza Yousaf, taking 47.9% of the vote to his 52.1% in the final ballot. She subsequently left government to sit on the SNP backbenches. Her leadership bid drew significant attention. She has membership of the Free Church of Scotland, an evangelical Calvinist denomination with socially conservative positions,[1][2][3] and holds religious views on sexual ethics, including disavowal of sexual intercourse before marriage, rejection of same-sex marriage, and opposition to most abortions.[4][5][6]
Early life[edit]
Kate Elizabeth Forbes was born in Dingwall in Ross and Cromarty, Scotland on 6 April 1990.[7][8] She is the eldest of four siblings: her mother is a teacher and her father is an accountant.[9] Her parents were missionaries for the evangelical Free Church of Scotland.[10] She spent her early years in the village of Marybank, where her parents ran a small business.[11] At an early age,[8] Forbes moved to India for three years, where her father worked for various religious charities to provide healthcare to people who could not afford it.[7][12] Forbes' father later studied for a PhD in the Indian Stock Exchange and managed hospitals, relying on charitable donations because he made no income.[9]
Forbes attended Selwyn College, Cambridge from 2008 to 2011She returned to Scotland and was taught in a Scottish Gaelic school, where she became fluent in the language.[13] She returned to India when she was ten and studied at Woodstock School in the foothills of the Himalayas.[8] Forbes returned to Scotland, this time in Glasgow, at the age of 15 where she attended a secondary school in the city before moving back to the Highlands to finish her schooling at Dingwall Academy.[7][9]Forbes attended Selwyn College in the University of Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in History in 2011.[7] She then studied at the University of Edinburgh, where she gained a Master of Science in Diaspora and Migration History in 2013.[7][8][12]Forbes joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 2011, having previously been active in the party's youth wing the Young Scots for Independence.[9]
Early career[edit]
After graduating, Forbes worked in the Scottish Parliament in 2011 as a researcher for Dave Thompson, the SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.[14] In February 2023, openDemocracy revealed her first, year-long job as a researcher was funded by Christian Action, Research and Education, which is known for its opposition to abortion and LGBT rights.[15][16][17]Forbes later studied to qualify (qualifying after she was elected  in 2016) as a chartered accountant and worked at Barclays for two years as a trainee graduate accountant.[18]
Political career[edit]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2016In August 2015, Forbes was selected from an all-women shortlist by local SNP members as their candidate for the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency held by Dave Thompson who would not be standing at the next election. She was part of an SNP campaign to address the gender pay gap around employment in the Highlands.[19] She was elected in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, doubling the majority from her predecessor from 4995 to 9045.[20][21][22]
Backbencher (2016–2018)[edit]
As a backbencher, Forbes was Convener of the Scottish Parliament's Cross-Party Group on Gaelic. She served on the Scottish Parliament’s Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee, the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, the Health and Sport Committee and the Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee.[23][24] She also served as Parliamentary Liaison Officer for Finance and the Constitution.[25]
In 2017, Forbes launched The Final Straw, a national campaign to ban the use of plastic straws in Scotland.[26] The campaign was supported by the Marine Conservation Society.[27] Forbes wrote to all of Scotland's 32 councils to support the campaign, with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar being the first Scottish council to pledge to go plastic straw-free.[28] Her campaign was successful after a ban of single-use plastic was introduced in August 2022.[29]Forbes speaking at the 2018 SNP ConferenceIn March 2018, she delivered an entire speech to the parliament in Gaelic during a plenary debate on the language.[30] She has spoken in favour of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage status as a possible way to protect the language.[31] She campaigned for local issues, such as increasing the number of foster carers in the Highlands,[32] and raised concerns of a lack of teachers in specialist subjects in the Highlands.[33]In May 2018, Forbes called on the government to let children practise religious belief in school without mockery, saying ""I wanted to note that pupils should be allowed to explore, develop and understand the diversity of religious faith in Scotland, because if they can understand it in school you will hope that as they go through the rest of their life they will be tolerant of people who believe that things are different to them.""[34]Forbes was awarded ""One to Watch"" at the 2018 Scottish Politician of the Year awards,[35] having been nominated the previous year.[36]
Deputy Finance Secretary (2018–2020)[edit]
On 27 June 2018, she was appointed to the Scottish Government as Minister for Public Finance and Digital Economy, as part of a wider reshuffle announced by First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon.[37] She supported the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work.[38]In September 2018, The David Hume Institute reported that the government had made ""no progress"" on improving productivity in workplaces; Forbes commented that ""over the last decade, productivity in Scotland has grown at more than three times the rate it has across the UK as a whole"".[39][40] In 2018, Forbes reiterated the SNP's commitment to 100 per cent broadband coverage throughout Scotland; the original 2021 completion target was later put back.[41][42] Forbes opposed the proposal to devolve business rates to Scottish councils.[43]

(From left to right; Jenny Gilruth, herself, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and Fiona Hyslop.)On 6 February 2020, the day of the 2020 Scottish Budget, Derek Mackay resigned as the finance secretary, after the Scottish Sun reported he had inappropriately messaged a 16-year-old boy on social media.[44] Forbes was left to deliver the budget within hours of preparation.[45] Prior to this, no woman had delivered a Budget in either the Scottish Parliament or Westminster.[46] Due to the late delivery of the UK Budget, Forbes raised concerns of the impact this would have on the passing of the Scottish Budget and told the Scottish Parliament there would be a very brief period for MSPs to scrutinise it.[47]In the budget, she announced there would be no changes to income tax rates and that the threshold for upper rates will be frozen, calling it the ""fairest and most progressive income tax system in the UK"".[48]
Cabinet Secretary for Finance (2020–2023)[edit]
On 17 February 2020, Forbes was appointed Cabinet Secretary for Finance—the first woman to hold the post.[49] In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, she was re-elected with a majority of 15,681 votes, 7,000 more than in the previous election.[50] Sturgeon formed her third administration and re-appointed Forbes as Finance Secretary, with economy added to her portfolio, as Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy.
In July 2022, John Swinney took on responsibility for the Finance and Economy portfolio as Forbes went on maternity leave. She is the first Cabinet Secretary in the Scottish Government to take maternity leave.[51][52]Forbes left the Scottish Government in March 2023 after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon resigned, and new First Minister Humza Yousaf offered her the role of Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Islands in his Government. This was deemed as a demotion and Forbes rejected Yousaf’s offer, therefore she left government on the 28 March 2023.

COVID-19 pandemic[edit]
Further information: COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland
Forbes with Florent Menegaux, Chief Executive of Michelin at Atlantic Quay Glasgow in November 2021During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank of England ordered a round of quantitative easing to keep UK borrowing affordable and interest rates low. SNP policy is that during the early years of independence Scotland would use sterling without a formal currency union and so would not have a central bank that could perform quantitative easing.[53] In December 2021 Forbes responded to a query on this issue and posed the question, ""Would it be such a great loss not to be able to conduct quantitative easing?""[54][55] When the issue was raised at a session of First Minister's Questions, Forbes' query was labelled ""economically illiterate"" by Labour MP Ian Murray.[56]Ahead of Christmas 2021 Forbes delivered her budget in which she spoke of ""very difficult choices"" because of the ""acute"" problems posed by Covid.[57] All 32 of Scotland's Council leaders wrote to the Scottish Government to complain about Forbes' £371 million cut in real terms to local authority funding. Cosla President Alison Evison said, ""Many in the meeting described this settlement for local government as the worst they had seen. Council leaders were clear last night that we could not sit back and simply accept this and there was a real strength of feeling that enough is enough.""[58]
2022 Scottish budget[edit]
Forbes visiting Goodtrees Neighbourhood Centre ahead of the 2022 Scottish budget on 8 December 2021.In December 2021, Forbes introduced the 2022 Scottish budget, detailing the government's spending proposals amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It also outlined the recent election win pledges made by the SNP and the policies of the SNP-Green agreement.[59][60]Forbes laid firm her commitment to keep income tax rates the same, however, the budget increased the thresholds at which it is paid for low income earners.[61][62] For Scottish Landfill Tax, standard rates and lower rates are set to be increased, while land and buildings transaction tax rates will remain at the same level.[63] Forbes announced the council tax freeze, which was imposed last year, would come to an end.[64][65] This gives councils in Scotland the ability to set their own rates for the first time since the SNP came into power in 2007.[66] The budget set out £1.95bn to begin the delivery of the Adult Disability Payment, with a total £4bn funding into social security. This includes £197M to double the Scottish Child Payment, from £10 to £20.[67]
2023 SNP leadership candidacy[edit]
Campaign logoOn 15 February 2023, Nicola Sturgeon announced her intention to resign the leadership of the Scottish National Party and First Minister of Scotland, which triggered a leadership election within the SNP to elect her successor.[68][69] Forbes is considered a ""rising star"" within the party,[70] although her religious views have been seen as an obstacle by some party members.[71][2][72] She is a member of the Free Church of Scotland, an evangelical Calvinist denomination with socially conservative positions, such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage.[3][73] Forbes has previously stated she ""[makes her] own decisions"" on issues ""according to [her] faith, not according to the diktat of any church"".[2][74]Forbes officially launched her candidacy for leader on 20 February, stating she could not ""sit back and watch our nation [be] thwarted on the road to self-determination."".[75][76]  Forbes told STV News on 20 February that she would not have supported the Gender Recognition Reform bill in its current form and she does not support challenging the Westminster's government's Section 35 order stopping it, instead seeking negotiation with Westminster to agree changes to the bill.[77] In an interview with the BBC, she declared that she would have resigned as finance minister over the GRR bill were she not on maternity leave at the time of its passage.[78]Following Forbes' comment that she does not support same-sex marriage, SNP MSPs who had previously supported her candidacy, including Richard Lochhead, Clare Haughey, Tom Arthur, Gillian Martin and Drew Hendry, withdrew their support.[79] In a Twitter statement released on 23 February, Forbes expressed regret at the ""hurt"" her comments caused to her ""friends, colleagues and fellow citizens"". She pledged that she would ""protect the rights of everybody in Scotland"".[80]A poll released on 25 February 2023 suggested that 23% of Scottish voters preferred Forbes as first minister, compared to 15% who preferred Humza Yousaf and 7% who preferred Ash Regan. The same poll indicated that 20% of 2021 SNP voters preferred Forbes as first minister, compared to 18% for Yousaf and 9% for Regan.[81]Forbes came in second place with 23,890 votes, equating to 47.9% of the overall vote share.[82]
Backbencher (2023–present)[edit]
Forbes on the SNP backbenches, March 2023Following Forbes defeat in the leadership election, newly appointed First Minister Humza Yousaf invited Forbes to serve in his cabinet as rural affairs secretary.[83] Opponents to the Yousaf campaign called this move a demotion, however, Forbes emphasised any role in government was privilege to her.[84] She turned down the offer and instead left government.[85][86] She sits as an SNP backbencher, where she continues to represent her Highland constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.[87]Forbes was announced as a new columnist for The National in April 2023.[88]In her first interview since her leadership bid, Forbes told BBC Radio 4 the SNP needs to take decisive action amid the party's fraud inquiry by Police Scotland.[89] She described the events that followed Sturgeon's resignation as turmoil for the party.[90] Forbes quoted her leadership slogan of ""continuity won't cut it"" as she urged for integrity, trust and transparency for voters.[91]
Political positions[edit]
Forbes has widely been described as socially and economically conservative, in contrast with the generally socially liberal policies of the SNP.[92][93][94][95]During her leadership campaign, Forbes received scrutiny of her religious and socially conservative views on abortion and LGBT rights.[96] In an interview with STV News, she criticised the ""illiberal"" debate about her religious views and questioned the meaning of liberalism, stating ""have we become so illiberal that we cannot have these discussions? Because if some people are beyond the pale then those are dark and dangerous days for Scotland.""[97][98][99]
Scottish independence[edit]
As a member of the SNP, she supports Scottish independence.[100] During the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Forbes told business leaders she wanted a second Scottish independence referendum to be held once the ""immediate impact"" of the pandemic was over.[101] She has called for a restart of the SNP's independence strategy.[102] She has considered Sturgeon's proposal of using a parliamentary election as a de facto referendum to be a way to apply pressure on the UK government to grant permission to hold a formal referendum ""rather than it being necessarily a referendum in and of itself"".[103] She said she wanted to achieve independence by delivering economic growth.[104] At the first hustings, Forbes said she would seek the ""legal powers to hold a referendum"" on independence within 3 months of the new UK general election.[105]
Economic policy[edit]
Forbes with Simon Clarke, Rebecca Evans, and Conor Murphy at  the Finance Interministerial Standing Committee in Cardiff, July 2022In 2018, Forbes was a member of the Sustainable Growth Commission, a blueprint of the economic policy and currency for an independent Scotland.[106] The commission proved unpopular among many left-wing SNP members for its embrace of liberal economics.[107] The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) stated it would ""further austerity under the SNP Sustainable Growth Commission's plans"", while Common Weal, a left-wing pro-independence think tank, described it as shifting the Scottish economy to the right.[108][109] Forbes supported the proposed currency arrangement of 'sterlingisation', which would mean an independent Scotland would not benefit from the central bank quantitative easing, a monetary policy of massive borrowing programmes during times of economic crisis.[110]As finance secretary, she stressed the need for more progressive taxation in order to tackle inequality and support economic growth.[111] In March 2022, Forbes launched a report outlining Scotland's National Strategy for Economic Transformation, which is her plan to improve Scotland's economy over the following 10 years.[112][113][114]In her official manifesto, Forbes put eradicating poverty at the heart of her economic policy with economic growth centre.[clarification needed][115][116]OpenDemocracy claimed her economic agenda was ""dangerous"" and compared her economic policy to that of George Osborne and David Cameron, who oversaw a large-scale austerity programme in the early 2010s.[117] Forbes stated the Scottish Government's proposed deposit return scheme would cause ""economic carnage"".[118][119]
Social issues[edit]
Abortion[edit]
In 2018, Forbes made a pro-life statement at a prayer breakfast, saying that the treatment of the unborn is a ""measure of true progress"" one day after a Westminster debate on abortion.[120] In 2023, she said she ""couldn’t conceive of having an abortion"" herself, however, she ""wouldn’t change the law as it stands"".[121] Forbes supports buffer zones for abortion clinics as she has said that women should not “be subjected to fear and harassment”.[122]
Premarital sex[edit]
Forbes has stated that she is opposed to sex before marriage and to childbirth before marriage, considering it ""wrong according to [her] faith""; however, she stated that ""the birth of a child should still be celebrated"". Forbes also stated that others have the choice to do so, as ""In a free society you can do what you want"".[123]
Same-sex marriage[edit]
On 20 February 2023, Forbes stated that if she had been an elected MSP in Holyrood when same-sex marriage was legalised in Scotland in 2014 she would have voted against the measure.[124] However, in the same interview she clarified that she would not attempt to reverse existing same-sex marriage laws in Scotland.[125]
Transgender rights[edit]
Forbes has stated that she believes that a trans woman is a ""biological male who identifies as a woman"".[126] She said a ""rapist cannot be a woman"" and that Isla Bryson, a transgender woman who was convicted of raping of two women prior to her gender transition, is ""man"".[127]In April 2019, Forbes was one of 15 SNP politicians who signed a public letter calling on the Scottish Government to delay its manifesto commitment to reform the Gender Recognition Act in Scotland.[128] In January 2022, she told The Times that her position had not changed, that the Scottish Government should not rush to change the ""definition of male and female"" and said the Scottish Government ""risked creating bad law"".[129] In the same month, Forbes signed off the proposed bill in a Scottish Cabinet meeting and when later asked why she did so despite her concerns she refused to answer.[130] She did not participate in the final vote on the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill in December 2022 due to being on maternity leave.[131] She later stated that she would not have supported the bill.[132][133]

Personal detailsBornKathryn Sloan Clark (1967-07-03) 3 July 1967 (age 56)Kilwinning, North Ayrshire, ScotlandNationalityBritishPolitical partyLabourAlma materUniversity of AberdeenUniversity of EdinburghKathryn Sloan Clark, Baroness Clark of Kilwinning (born 3 July 1967),[1] is a British politician and life peer who has served as a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West Scotland region since 2021. A member of the Labour Party, she was Member of Parliament (MP) for North Ayrshire and Arran from 2005 to 2015.

Early life and career[edit]
Clark was born in Kilwinning, and went to Ayr Grammar Primary School then Kyle Academy, both in Ayr, before attending the University of Aberdeen,[2][3] receiving an LLB in 1990. She was Chair of Aberdeen University Labour Club, NUS (Scotland) Women's Officer and active in women's campaigns, anti-poll tax campaigning, and the campaign against the Gulf and then Iraq War. She received a Diploma in Legal Practice from the University of Edinburgh in 1991.[3] She qualified as a solicitor in England, Scotland and Wales specialising in civil litigation, criminal defence work and employment law. She was active in MSF trade union and Edinburgh and District Trades Council in the 1990s before joining TGWU in 1998.
She was a solicitor in private practice in Edinburgh and Musselburgh from 1991 to 1998,[4] an Executive Member of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, and a legal officer, then Head of Membership Legal Services with UNISON[5] nationally from 1998 to 2005. Whilst at the latter organisation, she undertook employment litigation, including Europe's biggest equal pay case, in which she won £35m in back pay for female nurses and other medical staff in the North West of England who had been unlawfully underpaid compared with their male colleagues.[4][6]She joined the Labour Party at the age of seventeen[7] and is a member of the Unite, GMB and UNISON trade unions. Her great-great grandfather, Alexander Sloan, was Labour (ILP) MP for South Ayrshire from 1939 until his death in 1946.[5]
House of Commons: 2005–2015[edit]
Clark unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary seat of Galloway and Upper Nithsdale at the 1997 general election, a traditional Conservative and Scottish National Party (SNP) marginal. She finished in third place behind the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Ian Lang, who lost his seat to the SNP's Alasdair Morgan.[8]She was elected to the House of Commons at the 2005 general election for the new seat of North Ayrshire and Arran, based substantially on the former seat of Cunninghame North, whose MP Brian Wilson had retired, and the towns of Stevenston and Kilwinning from the old Cunninghame South.[9] She had a majority of 11,296,[10] and made her maiden speech on 7 June 2005.[11] She was nominated for House magazine's 'Maiden Speech of the Year'. Following the election, The Guardian named her as one of eight new MPs ""to watch"".[5]
Campaigns[edit]
Socialism and anti-austerity[edit]
One of the few left-wing members of Labour's 2005 intake of MPs,[9] she was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group[12] and a founder member of the Scottish Labour Party Campaign for Socialism.[13] Of the twenty-four members of the Campaign Group, she was the only one under the age of 50.[9][12]In 2010, Clark was one of only seven MPs to vote for left-winger Diane Abbott in the 2010 Labour Leadership Election.[14] In February 2013, she was among those who gave their support to the People's Assembly Against Austerity in a letter published by The Guardian newspaper,[15] and  was co-chair of the Labour Assembly Against Austerity.
Clark established a reputation as a rebel within the Parliamentary Labour Party, voting against ID cards.[16] However, she did not consider herself to be a rebel, stating that her ""views are consistent with Labour's traditions"".[17] She was one of 16 signatories of an open letter to party leader Ed Miliband in January 2015, calling on the party to commit to oppose further austerity, take rail franchises back into public ownership and strengthen collective bargaining arrangements.[18]
Human rights and internationalism[edit]
Clark campaigned on human rights issues, and was one of 95 Labour MPs who opposed replacing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons system.[19] She supported a 'No' vote in the 2011 AV Referendum.[20]Clark supported the call for the recognition of the state of Palestine.[21] She was amongst a handful of MPs who opposed the bombing of Libya, and was a member of the Committees on Arms Export Controls,[22] regularly calling for stricter limits on arms sales.[23]Clark is a Patron of the Greek Solidarity Campaign.

Refugee rights[edit]
Clark campaigned to support European Union emergency plans to ensure safety for migrants crossing the Mediterranean.[24]
LGBT rights[edit]
Throughout her time as an MP, Clark consistently voted in favour of increased rights for LGBT+ people,[25] including voting in favour of same-sex marriage in 2013.[26]
Constituency campaigns[edit]
On local issues, she campaigned against the contracting out of Calmac lifeline ferry services, with her first Parliamentary Question being about the tendering of services; for compensation of the victims of the Farepak Christmas savings scheme;  against the privatisation of DM Beith; against the closure of Coastguard Stations and job centres; and for the retraining of former workers employed at the closed Simclar factory.[27][28]
Trade union campaigns[edit]
She was Secretary of the Trade Union Group of Labour MPs and Chair of the CWU Group of MPs, taking up many trade union, equalities, human rights, consumer and employment rights issues in Parliament. She was also a member of the GMB, UNISON, FBU, Bakers Union, NUJ, UNITE, PCS, RMT, ASLEF and TSSA Parliamentary Groups.[3]
Royal Mail privatisation[edit]
As a member of the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee,[22] Clark held UBS and Goldman Sachs bankers to account, questioning them over their valuation of the Royal Mail during its privatisation.[29]
Scottish Deputy Leadership Campaign 2014[edit]
Clark was not elected when she stood as a left candidate to be Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2014, arguing for a change in direction.[7] She lost her Commons seat of North Ayrshire and Arran at the May 2015 general election to the SNP candidate Patricia Gibson.[30]
Leadership of Jeremy Corbyn: 2015–2020[edit]
Clark was an early supporter of Jeremy Corbyn's 2015 leadership campaign.[31] a key strategist on the campaign and was appointed as his Political Secretary in November 2015, following his election as leader.[32]In 2017, Corbyn tasked Clark with leading a review into the democratic functioning of the Labour Party at every level, including Labour Leadership Elections, the makeup of the National Executive Committee, giving Labour members greater say in party policy, building Constituency Labour Parties, local and regional Government and improving the situation of women, LGBT+, BAME, disabled and young members.[33]
Announcing the review in a message to Labour Members, Clark said:We want our members to be at the heart of our party – to have more power – over policy, how we campaign, organise and run our party, just as we want the people of Britain to be at the heart of deciding how our communities, economy and society are organised. That is what the democracy review is about.[34]The Democracy Review reported in September 2018, and rule changes to increase party democracy were adopted.[35] Clark has suggested that she would like these reforms to go further and that some of her proposed reforms were watered down.[36]Clark was proposed as a candidate to stand in Rochdale prior to the 2017 general election,[37] having previously withdrawn from consideration for election to the Leigh constituency because of accusations by local members of her being a parachute candidate.[38] Clark was not elected when she stood as a Labour candidate on the London list at the 2019 European Parliament election.[39] Later in 2019, she was shortlisted along with local councillors Ibrahim Dogus and Florence Eshalomi for the South London seat of Vauxhall at that year's general election, securing a personal endorsement from John McDonnell as well as the left-wing campaign group Momentum.[40] Clark finished in second place losing out to Eshalomi.[41]
House of Lords and Scottish Parliament: 2020–present[edit]
Clark was created Baroness Clark of Kilwinning, of Kilwinning in the County of Ayrshire, on 3 September 2020, under which name she is a member of the House of Lords as a Labour peer.[42]Clark was elected as a member of the Scottish Parliament for the West Scotland region for the Scottish Labour Party, having also stood as its candidate for the Cunninghame North constituency at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[43] Prior to her election, Clark previously expressed her intent to 'stand down' from the House of Lords if elected to Holyrood.[44] She took a leave of absence in May 2021, due to being elected to the Scottish Parliament.[45] She was appointed as Shadow Minister for Community Safety in the Scottish Labour shadow cabinet in May 2021.[46]
Views[edit]
Clark is a socialist and was regarded as being on the left of the Parliamentary party when she was an MP.[4] She was opposed to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit plan, called for a second referendum and was committed to campaigning for ""remain"" if such a vote were to take place.[47]
Personal life[edit]
Clark has lived in Scotland and Vauxhall, having moved to London in 1998,[48] and has a daughter.

Personal detailsBorn1967/68 (age 55-56)Pakistan[1]Political partyScottish National PartySpouseRichard StewartChildren2ProfessionEducatorWebsitekaukabstewart.scotKaukab Stewart (born 1967/68 )[2] is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Kelvin since May 2021.
At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, she became one of the first women of colour elected to the Scottish Parliament, alongside Pam Gosal.[3][4]
Early life and career[edit]
Stewart was born to Pakistani parents in Pakistan[5] and moved with her family to Northampton, England when she was two years old, where she attended Northampton School for Girls. She then moved to Glasgow, Scotland, aged sixteen[6] and attended Bellahouston Academy in Glasgow and Moray House School of Education in Edinburgh.[7]Prior to her election, she worked as a primary school teacher for nearly 30 years,[8][9] alongside pursuing a political career, which she earlier admitted as challenging even with a ""sympathetic headteacher....you have a duty to the kids, who must come first.""[10]She married Richard Stewart[11] on 14 September 1989.[12] They have two children.[7]
Political career[edit]
Stewart joined the Scottish National Party in 1994. ""For me it is all about the fact that I was always a supporter of equal rights and self-determination,"" she explained. ""I always wanted control over my own affairs and it was a natural progression to put that into a Scotland context. To be able to do what you want to do, when you want to do it and how you want to do it is very important to me.""[6]She stood unsuccessfully as a SNP candidate in the first Scottish Parliament election since devolution, against Donald Dewar for Glasgow Anniesland at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election.[13][14] Eleven years later, she stood unsuccessfully against former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling at the 2010 general election.[15][16] Speaking about these experiences in September 2020, Stewart said: ""In these elections I knew my chances of being elected were close to zero but it was that dream of a better nation which inspired me to carry on... It's thanks to the hard work of the activists I worked with then that we are where we are today.""[17]On 6 November 2020, Stewart was selected as the SNP candidate in Glasgow Kelvin for the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[18] At the election, she was elected as Kelvin's Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) with a majority of 5,458 votes.[19] Her election was noted in the UK press and abroad, such as The Japan Times and Le Parisien.[20][21]Stewart was appointed in June 2021 as deputy convenor of the Holyrood education committee which scrutinises Scottish education policy and its lead bodies.[22]She was interviewed for Channel 4 blog The Political Slot on her party's vision for equality in Scotland.[5]In January 2023, she was one of a number of Scottish politicians who drew media attention and criticism after being photographed smiling in front of a sign reading 'Decapitate TERFs' and a drawing of a guillotine at a Glasgow rally.[23] She subsequently claimed that she had not seen the sign in question and commented that ""Violent hate speech is totally unacceptable and has absolutely no place in our public discourse.""[24] This explanation met with some ridicule, including from the author J.K. Rowling, who commented, ""I too beam with delight when having my photograph taken with things of which I am entirely unaware"".[25] The sign was reported to Police Scotland.[26] Fellow MSP Murdo Fraser described the sign as ""clearly a hate crime and a public order offence"".[27]

A prominent member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she was an early supporter of the political career of Nicola Sturgeon, who later became First Minister of Scotland.

Early life[edit]
Catherine Mario Morrison[3] was born on 5 May 1943 in Prestwick as the only child of Jack Dallas Morrison and Charlotte Morrison (née Neil).[4][5] Her father was a member of the Scottish Unionist Party.[4] She was educated at Ayr Academy, before gaining a Certificate of Qualification in Social Work at Queen's College in Glasgow.[6]In 1965, Ullrich joined the Scottish National Party (SNP), having felt anger at Polaris nuclear missiles being stationed on the Clyde,[7] and campaigned for Scottish independence all her life.[6][7] She was a school swimming instructor from 1973 to 1982 and then worked as a school, hospital and court social worker from 1984 to 1997.[8][9] She retired early from social 1997.[6]
Political career[edit]
Ullrich stood unsuccessfully as an SNP candidate in several general elections: in Cunninghame South (1983 and 1987)[10][11] and in Motherwell South (1992) with Andrew Wilson as her election agent.[12] The death of Labour Leader John Smith in May 1994 triggered the Monklands East by-election, in which Ullrich also stood as an SNP candidate. She reduced Labour's majority in the election, but was defeated by Helen Liddell.[13][14]In the 1999 Scottish Parliament election Ullrich stood as a constituency candidate in Cunninghame North, where she was runner-up to Allan Wilson.[15] However, as she had been placed second on the SNP's West of Scotland list,[16] she was able to enter Parliament as a regional list Member.[17] By November, squabbles between Wilson and her around who might represent a constituent led to the deputy presiding officer George Reid stepping in to work towards clarifying the roles of constituency and regional list Members.[18] The ""Reid Principles"" were set out, incorporated into the Members of Scottish Parliament code of conduct and endorsed by Parliament.[19]During her time in Parliament, Ullrich served as deputy convener of the Equal Opportunities Committee (2000–2003) and convener of the Commissioner for Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill committee (January–March 2003).[20] She was also a member of the Health and Community Care Committee (1999–2003) and the Procedures Committee (2000–2001).[21] On 26 May 1999, Alex Salmond announced Ullrich as the shadow minister for health and community care.[22][23] The following year John Swinney replaced Salmond as SNP leader and days later, on 26 September 2000, she was appointed Chief Whip, a role which she held until the dissolution of parliament.[24][21] She stood down at the 2003 election.[25] After Parliament, she worked as a safeguarder with the Children's Panel.[2] In 2005, following the retirement of Winnie Ewing, Ullrich stood for the position of SNP President,[26] losing to Ian Hudghton.[27]In 1987, 16-year-old Nicola Sturgeon approached Ullrich to work on her election campaign. Ullrich later supported Sturgeon when she stood for selection as a candidate in Glasgow Shettleston in 1992, stating ""This lady here will be the first female leader of the SNP one day"".[7] Sturgeon acknowledged Ullrich as a mentor,[7] and Ullrich was present at the Scottish Parliament as a guest when Sturgeon became Scotland's first female First Minister.[28]Ullrich was a member of UNISON.[29]
Recognition[edit]
Ullrich was presented, posthumously, (received by her widower and granddaughter) with the SNP President's Prize by Michael Russell at the SNP party (virtual) conference in November 2021,  in recognition of her 'exceptional active commitment to the SNP and Scottish Independence'. The award was initiated by Winnie Ewing. Ms Sturgeon, in acknowledging Ullrich's  deserved award for her contribution said that ' I wouldn't be standing here today as First Minister of Scotland without the influence, the support, the mentoring of over decades of Kay Ullrich'.[30]
Personal life[edit]
Ullrich married and had two children; one son and one daughter, journalist Shelley Jofre.[31] She died on 4 January 2021 at the age of 77.[2][7][32]

Born in Edinburgh, Brown served in the Falklands War, while serving in the Royal Marines. Upon leaving, he graduated from the University of Dundee and studied abroad in Canada. He was elected to the Clackmannanshire Council, representing Alva, and later became the SNP's group leader. Brown served as the leader of Clackmannanshire Council between 1999 and 2003. In the 2007 Scottish election, he was elected to serve as the MSP for Ochil. He served as Minister for Schools and Skills from 2009 to 2010 and Minister for Transport and Infrastructure from 2010 to 2011.

Early life[edit]
Early years and education[edit]
Keith James Brown was born on 20 December 1961 in Edinburgh, where he attended Tynecastle High School. He served in the Royal Marines and served in the Falklands War.[1] After leaving, he attended the University of Dundee, graduating in Politics in 1988.[2] During his time at university, he studied abroad at the University of Prince Edward Island from 1985 to 1986.[3] He then went to work in local government administration in Stirling and was also an active trade union representative with UNISON.[3]
Early political years[edit]
While studying at Dundee University, Brown joined the Scottish National Party. He was the SNP's candidate for the European Parliament for Lothians constituency in 1994, coming second with 53,324 votes.[4] Brown was then elected to represent Alva on the Clackmannanshire Council in a by-election in 1996.[5] He became group leader in 1997, and then leader of the council after the 1999 elections when the council was under no overall control with the SNP forming the largest party. He remained leader of the council until Labour regained control of the council at the 2003 local elections.[2]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Brown was elected to the Scottish Parliament by Ochil constituency at the 2007 elections, increasing both absolute SNP vote and majority.[6]He was appointed to be Convener of both the Parliament's Standards & Public Appointments Committee and Procedures Committee, and after overseeing their merger now convenes the new Standards, Procedures & Public Appointments Committee.[7]In his maiden speech on the abolition of bridge tolls he declared that he still had an outstanding fine from the Skye Bridge protests of 1994.[8] He has been an opponent of the proposals for an overhead electricity line from Beauly to Denny, arguing for an underground alternative.[9] Brown has also been campaigning for Scotland international football matches to be available on terrestrial television.[10]
Junior Minister[edit]

On 8 December 2009, Brown became Minister for Schools and Skills In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government.[11]  In December 2010, he was appointed as Minister for Transport and Infrastructure in the Scottish government.[12]Brown won re-election to the Scottish Parliament in 2011, representing the newly created Clackmannanshire and Dunblane. On 19 May 2011, Brown was named as the Minister for Housing and Transport. On 5 September 2012, he became Minister for Transport and Veterans.

SNP Depute leadership bid, 2014[edit]
Further information: 2014 Scottish National Party leadership election
Following defeat in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Scottish National Party leader and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond announced his resignation as SNP leader and First Minister of Scotland.[13] In the aftermath of his resignation, a leadership bid was launched, with Deputy First Minister of Scotland and SNP Depute leader Nicola Sturgeon widely tipped to become Salmond's successor.[14][15]On 25 September 2014, Brown officially launched his bid to become the Depute leader of the Scottish National Party, with the backing of several SNP MSPs, as well as several Scottish Government ministers.[16][17] The results of the election were announced at the SNP Autumn Conference on the 14 November, with Brown losing the contest to Stewart Hosie, with 45.5% of the vote in the second round to Hosie's 55.5%.[18]
Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities[edit]
On 21 November 2014, he was promoted to Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities in Nicola Sturgeon's first reshuffle.[19] Brown was re-elected to the Clackmannanshire and Dunblane constituency in 2016.

Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work[edit]
On 18 May, he was reshuffled to the position of Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, while still maintaining responsibility for veterans affairs.[20]In December 2016, Brown led calls for Amazon to pay its employees the living wage after reports surfaced concerning the conditions of workers in the company's Dunfermline depot, holding talks with Amazon several days later in which he was told Amazon would ""consider"" paying the living wage.[21][22][23]In July 2017, Brown wrote to UK ministers on the need to continue legal protected status for the definition of Scotch whisky post-Brexit amid fears that in a future trade deal the USA “would support a relaxation of the definition of whisky, which would open the market up to a number of products which do not currently meet that standard.”[24][25][26] Later on in 2017 he visited the US and Canada in a series of speaking engagements to promote economic ties between North American business communities and Scotland.[27][28]
Depute leader of the Scottish National Party[edit]
Brown at 2018 SNP ConferenceOn 8 June 2018, Keith Brown became the depute leader of the Scottish National Party, having contested and won the 2018 Scottish National Party depute leadership election with 55% of votes in the second round.[29] At his acceptance speech at the SNP conference in Aberdeen, Brown told fellow SNP members to prepare for a second Scottish independence referendum.[30][31][32] Brown also announced that he would chair three national assemblies to debate the SNP's 2018 Growth Commission report on an independent Scotland's economic prospects.[30][33][34]Although Brown was elected Depute Leader of the SNP, John Swinney remained as Sturgeon's Deputy First Minister despite Brown being a member of the Scottish Parliament. In the June 2018 reshuffle of the Scottish Government, Brown stood down as Economy Secretary to focus on his role as depute leader, He was replaced by Derek Mackay. He was subsequently given a role as the SNP's Campaign Manager.

Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Veterans[edit]
Brown was re-appointed to the Scottish Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Veterans, in Nicola Sturgeon's third administration.[35]

Personal detailsBornKeith William Twort Raffan (1949-06-21) 21 June 1949 (age 74)Aberdeen, ScotlandNationalityBritishPolitical partyNone (since 2016)Other politicalaffiliationsConservative (until 1992)Liberal Democrats (1992–2016)Keith William Twort Raffan (born 21 June 1949) is a former British politician. From 1983 to 1992, he served in the British House of Commons as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the Delyn constituency in Wales.[1] Then from 1999 to 2005, he was a Scottish Liberal Democrat Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Mid Scotland and Fife region.

Early life[edit]
Raffan was born in Aberdeen and educated at Robert Gordon's College, Trinity College, Glenalmond, and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.[2] Prior to entering parliament he was a parliamentary sketchwriter for the Daily Express.[2]
Conservative MP, 1983–1992[edit]
Originally a Conservative, Raffan was in the early 1970s a chairman of Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism (a precursor of the Tory Reform Group), thus placing him on the left of the party. At this time he stood unsuccessfully for parliament in two general elections, at Dulwich in February 1974 and East Aberdeenshire in October 1974.[2]He was elected as Conservative MP for the Welsh seat of Delyn from 1983 to 1992, but his views on issues like drugs put him out of favour with the prevailing leadership of Margaret Thatcher, and he was never made a Minister. Raffan was one of the few Conservative MPs to support the 'stalking horse' leadership challenge of Anthony Meyer (his constituency neighbour in north Wales) against Thatcher in 1989, and he then supported Michael Heseltine's challenge to Thatcher the following year.

Scottish parliament, 1999–2005[edit]
Raffan stood down from the House of Commons at the 1992 general election and abandoned the Tories, in part because of his strong support for Scottish and Welsh devolution.[3] He joined the Liberal Democrats that same year,[4] and after working as a broadcaster and public relations consultant in New York and for Welsh TV channel HTV moved to Scotland.[2] In 1998 he stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate in the European Parliament by-election for North East Scotland, and soon afterwards was appointed the Scottish party's chief spokesman on home affairs.[2][5]In the 1999 Scottish Parliament election Raffan was elected as a regional list MSP to represent Mid Scotland and Fife. He was one of three Liberal Democrat MSPs – along with Donald Gorrie and John Farquhar Munro – who opposed the coalition with the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament, and was alone in his Liberal Democrat colleagues in not backing Donald Dewar for First Minister (he abstained from the vote). Noted for his flamboyant and theatrical manner when participating in debate, early in the parliament's first term he gained notoriety for tabling 38 written questions in one day.[4]Raffan was re-elected at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, and became a Vice Convener of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. However, in December 2004 he was subject to wide criticism for claiming abnormally large expense costs from the Scottish Parliament, including travel in his Fife constituency at times he was known to be in Parliament in Edinburgh. The following month he resigned as an MSP, citing ill-health (and not the controversy his expense claims had caused or the accusations of inappropriate sexual and bullying behaviour towards his staff) as the reason.
He faced further criticism after his resignation for working at ITV Wales despite being ""too sick to work"". He was replaced in his seat by Andrew Arbuckle, who had been next on the Liberal Democrat list for Mid Scotland and Fife in 2003. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have confirmed to the press that Raffan is no longer a party member.[citation needed]
After politics[edit]
In the run up to the 2018 local elections, Raffan wrote a letter to the Evening Standard declaring that he was going to vote for the Labour Party in Kensington where he was living.[1]He has subsequently left his third political party and now considers himself an independent.

 2014–2016: Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Community[b]Kenneth Donald Macintosh (born 15 January 1962) is a Scottish politician who served as the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2016 to 2021. Elected as a member of Scottish Labour, he suspended his party membership on becoming Presiding Officer. Macintosh was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2021, representing the Eastwood constituency from 1999 to 2016, and then the West Scotland region from 2016 to 2021.
Born in Inverness, Macintosh was employed between 1987 and 1999 as a television producer for the BBC, working on its news broadcasts and election coverage. He was first elected in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election as a Scottish Labour and Co-operative Party candidate, and retained his seat of Eastwood in the 2003, 2007 and the 2011 elections, but lost it in the 2016 election. In that election, he was returned on the regional list.

Early life[edit]
Family background and education[edit]
Kenneth Donald Macintosh was born on 15 January 1962 in Inverness. Macintosh was educated at the Portree and Oban primary schools before attending the state comprehensive Royal High School, Edinburgh. Both his parents were headteachers. His father, Dr Farquhar Macintosh CBE, was a Gaelic speaker from the Isle of Skye, a leading intellectual in Scottish education, rector of Royal High School and chair of the Scottish Examination Board.[1][2] His mother, Margaret Macintosh, came from Peebles and was head of Drummond Community High and assistant head of Wester Hailes Education Centre.[citation needed]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from the University of Edinburgh with a History MA (Hons) in 1984, Macintosh became a television producer in 1987 for the BBC News Network.[3] He also worked on Breakfast with Frost, Breakfast News, and the Nine O'Clock News. In addition, he also worked as a researcher on election programmes for both David Dimbleby and Jonathan Dimbleby.[4]
Political career[edit]
Early parliamentary career[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011At the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, Macintosh won the Eastwood constituency with a majority of 2,125 votes.[5]In February 2002, Macintosh was appointed as a ministerial parliamentary aide to Minister for Education and Young People, Cathy Jamieson.[6] He resigned from this role in September 2002 when he voted against the Labour–Liberal Democrat Coalition Scottish Executive over the closure of the A&E department at the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary.[7]Macintosh became Deputy Convenor on the Standards Committee but had to resign from this position in 2005 after it was revealed he had failed to declare £330 of hospitality from McDonald's within the required time.[8]In 2006 and 2007 Macintosh has proposed a Member's Bill to the Scottish Parliament providing for the tougher regulation of sunbed parlours, which passed successfully.[9] Since his election in 1999 has been a member of the cross-party group on cancer.[10] From February 2007 to April 2007, he was a ministerial parliamentary aide to First Minister Jack McConnell.[11]Macintosh was re-elected as MSP for Eastwood at the 2007 election with a narrow majority of 913, where he fought off a strong challenge from the Conservative Party's Jackson Carlaw.[12] After the election, Macintosh was appointed Shadow Minister for Schools and Skills. He considered running for the 2008 Scottish Labour leadership election but pulled out and instead backed Andy Kerr's candidacy.[13]At the 2011 parliamentary election he once again defeated Jackson Carlaw with an increased majority of 2,012. The swing was 8.7% from Conservative to Labour.[14] Macintosh had feared losing the constituency following boundary changes[15] (with the removal of Barrhead, Neilston and Uplawmoor) which gave a notional Conservative majority of almost 3,500.[16] After the party's loss to the SNP, Macintosh was made Shadow Culture and External Affairs Secretary.[17] Only a week later, however, he took over the Shadow Education portfolio after MSP Malcolm Chisholm resigned over an internal party disagreement.[18]
2011 and 2015 Scottish Labour Party leadership elections[edit]
Macintosh announced his candidacy in 2011 Scottish Labour leadership election. During a September 2011 BBC Scotland TV interview, Labour leader Ed Miliband was unable to recall Macintosh's name.[19] After the interview, Miliband telephoned to apologise for his mistake and Macintosh tried to downplay the incident saying ""I don't think anyone should read anything into it – half the time I can't even remember the names of my own kids.""[20] Macintosh officially launched his campaign at Cumbernauld College on 28 October. He described the 2011 election result as a ""disaster"" and said the party had been too negative: ""We need to unite as a party and to start talking positively about our values, what Labour stands for and not just what we are against.""[21][22] He later also said he was a devolutionist, not a unionist.[23][24] Despite lacking ministerial experience, he was widely seen as a frontrunner.[25] Colleagues who endorsed his bid included his campaign manager Michael McMahon, Claire Baker, Mary Fee, Neil Bibby, Mark Griffin, Kezia Dugdale, Jenny Marra and East Renfrewshire MP Jim Murphy, with whom Macintosh shared his constituency office in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire.[26][27] In the ensuing leadership election, Macintosh came second to MSP Johann Lamont.[28]Following Scottish Labour's near wipeout at the 2015 general election, Macintosh decided to stand again for the Scottish Labour leadership, triggered by the resignation of Jim Murphy.[29] Macintosh faced a straight two-way contest with previous deputy leader Kezia Dugdale,[30] who won the leadership.[31]
Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Macintosh lost the Eastwood constituency, being pushed into third place behind the Conservatives' Jackson Carlaw and the Scottish National Party's Stewart Maxwell. However, Macintosh was returned as an additional member on Scottish Labour's West Scotland regional list.[32]On 12 May 2016, Macintosh was elected as Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament with 71 votes on the third round of voting by MSPs. He defeated Murdo Fraser, Johann Lamont, John Scott and Elaine Smith. He suspended his Scottish Labour Co-operative membership upon taking office, per the tradition of the presiding officer being strictly non-partisan.
In early November 2018, Macintosh created controversy when an MSP was sent out of the Holyrood chamber for wearing a rainbow tie in support of LGBTI rights and liberation. Alex Cole-Hamilton, Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP for Edinburgh Western, was told to change the garment by Macintosh during a debate on LGBTI-inclusive education in schools. Macintosh said it flouted rules against ""ostentatious campaign material"" in the chamber.[33]In September 2020, Macintosh announced that he would not stand for re-election at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. In a letter to his constituents, he said: ""After much reflection, I have decided not to seek re-election to the Scottish Parliament in May next year. It has been an honour to represent the people of East Renfrewshire and the West of Scotland for the last two decades and I would thank you for the trust you have placed in me.""[34]
Personal life[edit]
Macintosh and his wife Claire live in Busby, East Renfrewshire with their six children.[35]

Personal detailsBorn (1961-09-08) 8 September 1961 (age 62)Paisley, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySpousePatricia Gibson MPAlma materUniversity of StirlingKenneth James Gibson (born 8 September 1961) is a Scottish politician serving as the Convenor of the Finance and Public Administration Committee since 2021. A member Scottish National Party (SNP), he has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Cunninghame North since 2007, having previously represented the Glasgow electoral region from 1999 to 2003.[1]
Career[edit]
Born in Paisley, Gibson served as an SNP councillor in Glasgow for Mosspark from 1992 to 1999, becoming the first ever party representative in the city to serve successive terms. Following the defection of three Labour councillors and a by-election win, Gibson (also known as 'Kenny')[2][3] became Leader of the Opposition on Glasgow City Council from January 1998 until being replaced on the council by his mother Iris in the election of 1999.
Gibson was first elected to the Scottish Parliament at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election as a list member for Glasgow electoral region.[4] Despite these efforts, he failed to win re-election in 2003.
In 2004, Gibson was third on the SNP's list for election to the European Parliament. In 2007, he was chosen to contest the constituency of Cunninghame North, winning that seat from Labour by the smallest margin in Scotland of 48 votes. In the subsequent 2011 SNP landslide election, Gibson secured a comfortable majority of 6,117 over Allan Wilson, the same Labour candidate, and former Scottish Minister, he had defeated by so slight a margin in 2007.[5]In addition to his constituency activities, Gibson was also the Convener of the Finance Committee in the Scottish Parliament from 2011 to 2016 and brought attention to enhanced financial powers in the Scotland Act 2012.[6] Gibson is currently a member of the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee[7] and the Local Government and Communities Committee.[8]Gibson is also actively involved in a number of Cross-Party Groups, serving as Convener of the Cross-Party Group on Epilepsy; the Cross-Party Group on Improving Scotland's Health: 2021 and Beyond; and the Cross-Party Group on Life Sciences.[9]
Controversies[edit]
In March 1993, when Gibson was a Councillor for Mosspark, a warrant for his arrest was issued following his failure to appear for trial in connection with an alleged offence under the Representation of the People Act.[10]In February 2000, The Sunday Mail reported allegations from a disabled SNP member, Gill Strachan, that Gibson had pushed and abused her during the SNP Conference in Inverness in October 1999. Strachan subsequently resigned from the SNP, accusing the party of mounting a cover-up of the incident.[11]In 2009, Gibson was criticised by other MSPs for writing to North Ayrshire Council in support of a planning application for 24 houses made by a friend, Billy Maclaren, while failing to disclose either the friendship or his financial relationships with Maclaren.[12]Gibson was identified as one of 12 Holyrood politicians employing a close family member in 2013, but declined to provide information on the salary, work hours, or whether the job had been advertised.[13] His wife Patricia Gibson (now an MP) was employed as a policy adviser. Employing family members was declared bad practice in 2010 and outlawed in 2015.[14]In March 2017, Holyrood's Standards Committee admonished Gibson for failure to make an oral declaration of a registered financial interest.[15] The Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in Scotland submitted a report to the Procurator Fiscal. However, the alleged offence was ""time barred from criminal proceedings.""[16] Political opponents called for his suspension from the SNP.[17]The Cunninghame North Constituency Association issued ""an urgent call"" for members to come forward to challenge Gibson to be the SNP representative for the area in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election campaign.[18] In October 2020, it was reported that Gibson would face a reselection challenge for the Cunninghame North Seat.[19] On 14 October it was reported that two SNP party officials had resigned in protest, with allegations that Gibson had been 'aggressive and abrasive' bullying, 'especially of women'.[20] The article quoted Cunninghame North Constituency Organiser Dr Malcolm Kerr as saying ""the allegations against Mr Gibson include bullying, harassment and abuses of parliamentary expenses rules."" Shortly after this, the SNP suspended the selection procedure in Cunninghame North in response to these allegations.[21]In December 2022, Gibson was said to be ""bordering on hate speech"" by Scottish Labour MSP Mercedes Villalba. This was during the Stage 3 debate on the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill, where Gibson, on the topic of housing ""anatomical males"" in women's prisons, stated ""If a fox said it was a chicken, would you put it in a henhouse? Of course not.""[22]

He previously served as Cabinet Secretary for Justice from 2007 to 2014 and was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2016. A former member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he defected to the Alba Party in 2021 and currently serves as the party's depute[a] leader.
Born in Edinburgh and educated at Linlithgow Academy, MacAskill studied law at the University of Edinburgh and was a senior partner in a law firm in Glasgow. He was a long-standing member of the SNP's National Executive Committee and served as treasurer and vice convener of policy, before being elected at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. He was convener of the Scottish Parliament Subordinate Legislation Committee from 1999 to 2001.
Following the SNP's victory in 2007, MacAskill was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Justice in the Scottish Government. In this role, he oversaw the controversial transfer of convicted terrorist Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to his native Libya. MacAskill left office in November 2014 in the Cabinet reshuffle which followed the appointment of Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister of Scotland and stood down from the Scottish Parliament at the 2016 election.
After standing down from the Scottish Parliament, MacAskill was elected to the House of Commons as MP for East Lothian at the 2019 general election, gaining the previously Labour-held seat from Martin Whitfield. In March 2021, MacAskill defected from the SNP to the Alba Party. At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, he stood on the Alba Party's Lothian regional list but neither he nor his party succeeded in gaining a seat.

Background, early life and career[edit]
MacAskill was born in Edinburgh and was educated at Linlithgow Academy before studying law at the University of Edinburgh, gaining an LLB (Hons) degree.[2] After completing his training at a firm in Glasgow, he set up Erskine MacAskill.
He came to prominence inside the SNP through his activities in the left wing 79 Group and became a party office bearer.  In the 1980s he led the ""Can't Pay, Won't Pay"" campaign in opposition to the Poll Tax. It was widely known that he often disagreed politically with Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP through the 1990s, and he was at one stage viewed as belonging to the SNP Fundamentalist camp, being perceived to be allied to figures such as Jim Sillars and Alex Neil within the party.

Member of the Scottish Parliament (1999–2016)[edit]
After MacAskill became an MSP in 1999 upon the establishment of the Scottish Parliament as a regional list member for the Lothians he moderated his political position, seeing the development of the Scottish Parliament as the most achievable route for Scotland to become an independent nation state. In this respect he was regarded as having adopted a gradualist approach to Scottish independence in place of his previous fundamentalist position. He was one of former SNP leader John Swinney's closest supporters.
In 1999 MacAskill was detained in London before the Euro 2000 second leg play-off match between Scotland and England on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly.[3] As he was not charged with any crime the incident did not affect his position within the SNP and he won re-election at the 2003 election.
In 2004, after John Swinney stood down as SNP party leader, Kenny MacAskill backed the joint leadership ticket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. He had initially intended to stand for deputy leader himself on a joint ticket with Nicola Sturgeon, who would have sought the leadership. He gave way when Salmond reconsidered his earlier decision not to seek re-election to the leadership. Upon their election as leader and deputy leader respectively, MacAskill was selected to be Deputy Leader of the SNP in the Scottish Parliament. He served in the SNP Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning from 2001 to 2003, Shadow Minister for Transport and Telecommunications from 2003 to 2004 and Shadow Minister for Justice from 2004 to 2007.
MacAskill authored a book, Building a Nation – Post Devolution Nationalism in Scotland, which was launched at the SNP's 2004 annual conference in Inverness. He has since edited another book Agenda for a New Scotland – Visions of Scotland 2020, and has co-authored Global Scots – Voices From Afar with former First Minister Henry McLeish.

Cabinet Secretary for Justice (2007–2014)[edit]
For the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, MacAskill was top of the SNP's party list for the Lothians region. He stood in the Edinburgh East and Musselburgh constituency, winning that seat from Scottish Labour with a 13.3% swing to give a majority of 1,382. This was the first time the SNP had ever won a parliamentary seat in Edinburgh. After the SNP's victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, MacAskill became the Cabinet Secretary for Justice.
One of MacAskill's first acts as a cabinet secretary was to lift the ban on alcohol sales at international rugby union games held at Murrayfield Stadium.[4]MacAskill also said that the 2007 terror attack on Glasgow Airport was not committed by 'home-grown' terrorists, in that the suspects were not ""born or bred"" in Scotland but had merely lived in the country for a ""period of time"".[5]MacAskill won election to a redrawn constituency of Edinburgh Eastern in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.[6] Despite notionally facing a deficit of 550 votes,[7] MacAskill won by over 2,000 votes.[6]
Pan Am Flight 103[edit]
Main article: Release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi
On 19 August 2009, MacAskill rejected an application by Libya to transfer to their custody Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, convicted of the Pan Am Flight 103 bomb that killed 270 people, acknowledging that ""the American families and Government had an expectation or were led to believe that there would be no prisoner transfer.""[8] The following day, on 20 August, MacAskill authorised al-Megrahi's release on compassionate grounds. Megrahi had served 8½ years of a life sentence, but had developed terminal prostate cancer.[9][10] The Justice Secretary has discretionary authority to order such a release, and MacAskill took sole responsibility for the decision.[11][12] Megrahi died on 20 May 2012.
In the United States, where 180 of the 270 victims came from, the decision met with broad hostility. Political figures including President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke out against it,[13][14] and families of the victims expressed indignation over the decision.[15][16][17][18]FBI director Robert Mueller, who had been a lead investigator in the 1988 bombing, wrote a highly critical open letter to MacAskill.[19] Former Labour First Minister Henry McLeish was critical of Mueller's attack on the decision.[20]In Britain, reaction was divided. Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray, former First Minister Jack McConnell, and former Scottish Office minister Brian Wilson criticised the decision,[21][22][23][24][25] while Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, former Labour MP Tam Dalyell and former British ambassador to Libya Richard Dalton publicly supported it.[26][27] Ian Galloway and Mario Conti, representatives of the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church respectively, also spoke in favour of the release.[28]John Mosey, a priest who lost a daughter on Pan Am Flight 103, expressed his disappointment that halting Megrahi's appeal before it went to court meant that the public would never hear ""this important evidence — the six separate grounds for appeal that the SCCRC felt were important enough to put forward, that could show that there’s been a miscarriage of justice.""[29]Saif al-Islam Gaddafi reiterated his belief in Megrahi's innocence commenting that the Justice Secretary had ""made the right decision"" and that history would prove this to be the case.[30] A letter in support of MacAskill's decision was sent to the Scottish Government on behalf of former South African President Nelson Mandela.[31]The Scottish Parliament was recalled from its summer break, for the third time since its creation, to receive a statement from and question MacAskill.[32] The opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament passed amendments criticising the decision and the way it was made, but no motions of confidence in MacAskill or the Scottish Government were tabled.[33]After MacAskill won re-election to the Scottish Parliament in 2011, an SNP supporter said that the decision had been mentioned by very few voters during the election campaign.[34]
Member of Parliament (since 2019)[edit]
MacAskill was chosen as the SNP candidate for East Lothian at the 2019 UK general election.[35] He was subsequently elected, overturning a 3,083 majority and defeating Labour's Martin Whitfield.[36]In April 2020, MacAskill called for the office of Lord Advocate to be split – similarly to the English and Welsh system of Attorney General for England and Wales and Director of Public Prosecutions – in a response to the trial of former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond, to avoid potential conflicts of interest.[37]In February 2020, MacAskill authored Radical Scotland – Uncovering Scotland's radical history – from the French Revolutionary era to the 1820 Rising, published by Biteback.
Following the launch of the Alba Party in March 2021, in advance of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, MacAskill announced that he was leaving the SNP to join Alba, making him their first sitting representative. He was reported as planning to stand for election to Holyrood in a regional list seat.[1] The SNP called on him to resign and trigger a by-election, describing his defection as ""somewhat of a relief"".[38] In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, he stood on Alba's Lothian regional list but neither he nor his party succeeded in gaining a seat.[39] Later that year, at the party's inaugural conference, he was elected as depute leader.[40]On 13 July 2022, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle ejected MacAskill and his Alba colleague Neale Hanvey (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) from the House of Commons for disrupting the start of Prime Minister's Questions. The two had been protesting about the refusal to grant consent for a second independence referendum.[41] As both Members were named by the Speaker, by convention MacAskill and Hanvey were handed five day suspensions from the House.

Personal life[edit]
MacAskill lives in Moray, where he has a house, and he also maintains a flat in his constituency, East Lothian.[42] He has two sons.[2]

A former member of the Scottish Labour Party and Co-operative Party, she was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothian region from 2011 to 2019.
Born in Aberdeen and raised in Dundee, Dugdale studied law at the University of Aberdeen and Policy Studies at the University of Edinburgh, where she was a campaigns and welfare adviser. After leaving university, she worked as an election agent, political researcher and parliamentary officer. She was elected at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election on the Lothian regional list and became Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2014.
Dugdale was elected Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in the 2015 Scottish Labour leadership election. She led the party into the 2016 Scottish Parliament election; where it finished third behind the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Scottish Conservatives; Dugdale failed to be elected to the Edinburgh Eastern constituency, once again being elected on the Lothian regional list. During the 2017 general election, the party held their previously sole seat and gained a further six seats from the SNP. She resigned as leader in August 2017 to ""pass on the baton"" to a successor who would lead the party into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.
After leaving frontbench politics, Dugdale worked as a columnist and appeared as a contestant on the seventeenth series of ITV reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in November 2017.

Early political career[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011Dugdale sat on Scottish Labour's Policy Forum from 2006 until 2008, as well as serving as an election agent to both Sarah Boyack MSP and Sheila Gilmore MP.[4] She had also volunteered as a researcher in the parliamentary office of Pauline McNeill MSP.[5] She worked from 2007 to 2011 for the Labour Lothian regional MSP George Foulkes, by then also a Labour life peer, as his parliamentary office manager and political adviser.[1]In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Dugdale was elected to the Scottish Parliament as Scottish Labour's second candidate on their list for the Lothian region. She served as a Scottish Labour and Co-operative Party member and sat on the Local Government and Regeneration and Subordinate Legislation Committees.[6][7] Dugdale was appointed as Scottish Labour's Spokesperson for Education and Lifelong Learning on 29 June 2013.[8]Dugdale won the 2014 Scottish Labour deputy leadership election, succeeding Anas Sarwar, and defeating Katy Clark. As Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy did not have a seat in the Scottish Parliament, she stood in for him at First Minister's Questions.[9] On 13 June 2015, she resigned from the deputy leadership in order to contest the 2015 Scottish Labour leadership election.[10] She was succeeded by Alex Rowley after the leadership election.[11]
Leader of the Scottish Labour Party[edit]
During the 2015 leadership election campaign, Dugdale said she would want to end the charitable status of private schools in Scotland which gives them tax breaks, a policy in her opinion unfair to state schools.[12] In a July 2015 televised leadership debate, she said it was wrong the vast majority of the 232 Labour MPs abstained on the Conservative government's Welfare Reform and Work Bill in a second reading vote in the House of Commons.[13] Following the resignation of Lord John Sewel on 28 July 2015, she said the House of Lords should no longer be an unelected chamber and should be moved to Glasgow.[14] She won the leadership on 15 August, defeating Ken Macintosh.[11]During an August 2015 interview with The Guardian, Dugdale refused to publicly say who out of the four candidates in the UK Labour Party leadership election she supported, but did express serious doubts as to whether Jeremy Corbyn could ever become Prime Minister.[14] After Corbyn had been elected as Leader of the Labour Party on 13 September, she revealed for the first time, on BBC Question Time on 30 October, she had voted for Yvette Cooper.[15]
Dugdale back in the Scottish Parliament following her defeat in the 2016 electionDugdale led Scottish Labour into the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. Dugdale wanted to re-affirm Scottish Labour's core beliefs and convey to the electorate what the party stood for. She focused her campaign on a proposal to increase income tax to tackle underfunding of services by the Scottish National Party government, particularly in education.[16] Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives' ambitions were to oppose Scottish independence and push Ruth Davidson as an effective leader opposed to the SNP's governmental agenda.[17] The results put Scottish Labour behind both the SNP and Scottish Conservatives, with the party falling into third place from second. The party made a net loss of 12 constituency seats, gaining only one and holding another two, but retained 21 of its 22 regional seats which assign additional members to address imbalance in constituency results. Dugdale was once again returned as an additional member for the Lothian region, having failed to win the Edinburgh Eastern constituency from the SNP by 5,087 votes.[18][19]On 29 June 2016, Dugdale called for Jeremy Corbyn to resign from his position as Leader of the Labour Party, after 174-to-40 Labour MPs voted no-confidence in his leadership. She said when 80% of his own MPs no longer supported him, Corbyn could not properly function as Labour leader or Leader of the Opposition in parliament, nor could he form a potential alternative government.[20] On 22 August, she declared her support for Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election but also said her position would remain tenable were Corbyn to win re-election.[21] After Corbyn won the leadership election, she first said that this made the Labour Party unelectable, then stated the opposite.[22]Dugdale was Leader of the Scottish Labour Party during the 2017 general election. In the previous general election in 2015, the party lost 40 of its 41 seats in what was a landslide victory for the SNP, who won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon based the 2017 SNP campaign on a promise to seek a second Scottish independence referendum with the aim of keeping an independent Scotland inside the European Union, a referendum Ruth Davidson and the Scottish Conservatives were opposed to.[23] Dugdale again campaigned on what she saw as the need for an income tax increase to tackle education underfunding by the SNP.[24]The results gave Scottish Labour seven seats. In their previously sole seat Edinburgh South, Ian Murray was returned with a super-majority of over 15,000, and the party gained a further six seats from the SNP. However, the party came in third place behind the SNP with 35 seats and Scottish Conservatives with 13.[25]On 29 August 2017, Dugdale resigned as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect, commenting that it was time to ""pass on the baton"" to someone else. She opined that her successor needed the ""space and time"" to prepare for the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021.[26]
Later career[edit]
In November 2017, ITV announced that Dugdale would appear as a contestant on its reality television series, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here![27] It was subsequently reported that she faced disciplinary action from the Labour Party because she did not notify party managers she would be out of the country on non-work related business while the Scottish Parliament was in session.[28] On 21 November, the party said that she would not be suspended.[29]Dugdale made her first appearance on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! on 22 November.[30] She became the second person to be eliminated from the show. Speaking about the experience afterwards, she said that she knew her appearance on the programme would be a ""political gamble"", but that she wanted to ""take on the myth that every politician [is] old, white, male, pale and stale"" and would return home ""with [her] head held high"".[31] She expressed regrets of the effect of her appearances on the show during the first weeks of the new Labour leadership in Scotland, and received a written warning for agreeing to take part without approval from the Scottish Labour parliamentary group.[32] She promised to donate her MSP's salary for her absence, and part of her show fees, to charity.[33]In 2018, Stuart Campbell, a blogger running the pro-independence Wings Over Scotland website, started defamation proceedings against Dugdale about comments she made as a columnist for the Daily Record about his Twitter activity, a case he lost. The judgement said Dugdale was incorrect to imply Campbell had been homophobic but her article was protected under the principle of fair comment.[34][35][36]On 29 April 2019, Dugdale announced she would be resigning as an MSP before the summer recess of the Scottish Parliament in order to take up the role of director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service at the University of Glasgow.[37] On 15 July 2019, Dugdale resigned as a Member of the Scottish Parliament.[38] The following day it was announced she would be succeeded by former transport minister Sarah Boyack, who had been a candidate on the Lothian regional list in 2016.[39] On 10 October 2019, it was revealed she had also resigned from Scottish Labour that July, following disagreement with the party over Brexit.[40]
Personal life[edit]
In a 2016 interview with Mary Riddell for the Fabian Review, Dugdale said she was in a relationship with a woman but was disinclined to provide details of her private life.[41][42] She first appeared in public with her partner Louise Riddell when they voted together in Edinburgh in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[43][44][45]In February 2017, Dugdale revealed the couple had separated shortly after the New Year and following nine years together.[46] In July 2017, it was reported Dugdale was in a relationship with Mid Fife and Glenrothes MSP Jenny Gilruth, a member of the SNP, and the two had started dating around four months earlier.[47] In June 2022, Dugdale married Gilruth in a private ceremony.[48][49]In September 2017, she was named Politician of the Year at the Icon Awards, an awards ceremony celebrating Scotland's LGBT community.[50] Dugdale's late father was retired teacher Jeff Dugdale, a campaigner for the Scottish independence movement.[51] Her relationship with her father had been left ""sad"" and ""sore"" by his public criticisms of her on Twitter and his support for Stuart Campbell in the defamation case against her.[52] Jeff Dugdale died on 10 September 2021.[53]Dugdale says her interests include the theatre, Scottish crime novels, and the city of Edinburgh. She supports Hibernian F.C., living close to their ground at Easter Road.[2] She has lived in the Lochend, and Meadowbank, area since 2006.[54] She is a member of Unite the Union and the Community trade union.[1] From 2014 until 2018, she published a weekly column in the Daily Record.[55] She has also written for LabourList and Progress.[4]
Notes[edit]

^ Normally, regional MSPs do not have individual predecessors and successors. However, Dugdale retired her seat during a sitting parliament so was succeeded by Boyack.

Political career[edit]
Brennan was elected to the East End ward of Dundee City Council in 2012. In October 2013, she was selected by Scottish Labour to contest Dundee East at the 2015 United Kingdom general election. However, she lost to the incumbent Stewart Hosie.[2][3]When Richard Baker resigned from the Scottish Parliament in January 2016, Labour nominated Brennan as his replacement as she had been next on their North East Scotland regional list.[4] Brennan was sworn in on 13 January 2016,[5] and served until the Parliament's dissolution two months later in March. She stood at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election where Labour had placed her third on their regional list for North East Scotland, but she was not re-elected.[6] As a former MSP who had not been re-elected, she received a resettlement package of more than £30,000.[7] In October 2016, she announced that she would not seek re-election when her term as councillor finished in 2017.[7]From 2016 to 2017, Brennan served as parliamentary assistant to Neil Findlay.[8] She was selected by Labour to contest Dundee East again at the 2017 general election.[9] She received 2,000 more votes than in 2015 but finished in third place behind Hosie and the Conservative candidate.[3] A member of Campaign for Socialism, she was appointed in November 2017 by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard to serve as his chief of staff.[10]

Personal detailsBorn (1956-12-14) 14 December 1956 (age 67)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySpouseDuncan McLeanResidence(s)Strathaven, ScotlandLinda Fabiani (born 14 December 1956) HonFRIAS OSSI FCIH is a Scottish politician who served as a Deputy Presiding Officer in the Scottish Parliament from 2016 to 2021. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the East Kilbride constituency from 2011 until her retirement in 2021. She was previously a regional member of the Scottish Parliament for the Central Scotland region from 1999 until 2011.

Early life and career[edit]
Fabiani was born in Glasgow to a family with both Scottish and Italian roots. Prior to entering politics, she worked as director of East Kilbride Housing Association.

Political career[edit]
At 1999, 2003 and 2007 elections, Fabiani unsuccessfully contested the first past the post constituency of East Kilbride finishing as runner up to Andy Kerr of Scottish Labour, reducing Labour's majority from 6,499 in 1999 to 1,972 in 2007. However, being listed at number five in the SNP regional list for Central Scotland in 1999, she gained a seat in the newly-established Scottish Parliament. She told the Dundee Courier in January 2021 that she had been surprised to get elected at her first attempt. Following the election of 2003, she served as the SNP's Deputy Spokesman on Communities inside the Scottish Parliament and chaired the Parliament's European and External Relations Committee.
In 2007, Fabiani was made Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity by Italy in recognition of her work promoting links between Scotland and Italy.[1]With the SNP taking control of the Scottish Government after the 2007 election,[2] Fabiani was appointed Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture. Half way through the SNP's term, she was replaced as minister by Mike Russell.
In 2009, she was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland. She is a former Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Housing of Scotland.[3]In May 2011, in the first SNP gain of the election, Fabiani took the East Kilbride constituency from Andy Kerr. With Kerr widely touted as a potential successor to Labour leader Iain Gray, this was one of the major SNP victories of the election.[4] On 21 June 2011 she became the Convener of the Scotland Bill committee.[5]After her election, she set up a constituency office in 1/3 Strathmore House in the town centre of East Kilbride.
After being re-elected in the 2016 election, Fabiani was elected as one of the two Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament.
In August 2020, Fabiani announced that she would not be seeking re-election in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[6]In her final term, Fabiani was chosen as convenor of the Scottish Parliamentary inquiry into the government's mishandling of claims made against Alex Salmond.[7]

Elizabeth Jane Smith CBE (born 27 February 1960) is a Scottish politician who has been Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Mid Scotland and Fife since 2007. A member of the Scottish Conservative Party, she has served as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy since 2021.
Before entering parliament, Smith was a schoolteacher and political researcher, as well as an amateur sportswoman, representing the Scottish women's cricket team. She was first elected in 2007 and re-elected in 2011 and 2016, having earlier stood unsuccessfully for the Parliament of the United Kingdom at the 2001 general election in the Perth constituency, where she missed out to the SNP by just 48 votes. She stood as a constituency candidate in the Perth constituency at the Scottish Parliament in 2007 and again in the newly established Perthshire South and Kinross-shire constituency in both 2011 and 2016, missing out by 1,422 votes in 2016. Smith served as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills from 2016 to 2020 and as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform from 2020 to 2021.

Early life and sporting career[edit]
Smith was born in Edinburgh, and attended George Watson's College before going on to the University of Edinburgh to study politics and economics and gain a Diploma in Education. After graduating, she returned to George Watson's College as a member of the staff, where she taught economics and modern studies. Smith left the teaching profession in 1997 to work as an advisor to Sir Malcolm Rifkind. Between 2001 and 2003, she worked at the Scottish Conservatives' central office, as head of the office of the chairman.[1]A keen sportswoman, Smith played club cricket for many years, but was not given an opportunity to play at a higher level until 2000, when the Scottish national side was reassembled for the first time since 1979.[2] Her first match for the national team came against Cumbria, an English county team, but she neither batted nor bowled as her team cruised to a ten-wicket victory.[3]In 2001, Smith was selected in the Scottish squad for the 2001 European Championship, where matches held One Day International (ODI) status.[4] On her international debut against England, she was 41 years and 164 days old, making her the fourth-oldest ODI debutant on record, and the oldest to debut since 1978.[5] Smith made nine-ball ducks against both England and Ireland,[6][7] and against the Netherlands.
Smith remains the oldest Scottish player, male or female, to appear in a full ODI.[8][9] She has remained involved in promoting the sport since retiring, and in April 2014, following a reconstitution of the organisation, was elected the inaugural president of the Scottish Women's Cricket Association (SWCA), aligned with Cricket Scotland.[10] Outside of cricket, Smith has an interest in mountaineering and hillwalking, having taken part in expeditions to the Alps and the Himalayas.[1] After climbing Slioch in July 2012, she completed the feat of ""bagging the Munros"" (climbing every mountain in Scotland over a set height). She had begun the task in 1982, with a climb of Ben Nevis, and after entering parliament used her climbs to raise funds for charity.[11]Smith was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to sport.[12]
Parliament[edit]
Smith was narrowly beaten (by just 48 votes) to the Perth seat at the 2001 General Election by the SNP's Annabelle Ewing. She made The Herald Scottish Politician of the Year shortlist for 'The One to Watch' in 2007.[13] Smith acted as campaign manager for Murdo Fraser in his leadership election campaign in 2011.
She was first elected to the Scottish Parliament for the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region in 2007 and re-elected in 2011 and 2016, having earlier stood unsuccessfully for the Parliament of the United Kingdom at the 2001 UK general election in the Perth constituency, where she missed out to the SNP by just 48 votes. She stood as a constituency candidate in the Perth constituency at the Scottish Parliament in 2007 and again in the newly established Perthshire South and Kinross-shire constituency in both 2011 and 2016, missing out by 1,422 votes in 2016.
Smith is shadow cabinet secretary for education and skills.[14]
She sits on the Education and Skills Committee of the Scottish Parliament.[15]
She is also the chair of the Parliament's Cross Party Group on Colleges and Universities and co-chairs the Cross Party Group on Sport.

Controversy[edit]
Smith was criticised in 2018 by Holyrood's standards committee for forwarding a confidential dossier on allegations of bullying at George Watson's College to the school. Smith, who was a governor of the school at the time, forwarded an e-mail about bullying allegations to the chairman of the board of governors at the school and to its principal. The documents detailed specific allegations about the treatment of their child. Parents claimed Smith had disclosed information to others to which she had privileged access as an MSP.[16]

He was a Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland region from 1999 to 2003.
Born and raised in Edinburgh, Quinan is a longtime campaigner for Scottish independence, initially joining the Scottish National Party in 1974, later leaving in 2003. In 2015 the SNP selected him as a list candidate for the Lothian region.

Theatre and television career[edit]
A trained actor, he appeared in theatres throughout Scotland, including the Royal Lyceum, the Traverse, Perth Theatre, the Tron, Eden Court and the Pavilion. He was assistant director of the Scottish Theatre Company and founder of the independent company, United Artists (Scotland).
He directed new plays by Peter Arnott and George Gunn as well as the first Scottish production of Howard Barker's Pity In History. Working as a freelance director he worked with many companies and theatres including the Citizens Theatre Glasgow, Unit One, the Traverse, Mayfest, the Borders Festival, Craigmillar Festival Society and directed plays, pantomimes and community pageants. He was an elected member of the Scottish committee of the Equity Union for 12 years. Like so many theatre workers he had a parallel career in television appearing in a number of dramas for BBC Scotland, Granada, STV and ITV. While working for STV in 1983 he became a presenter in the education department making over 200 programmes on Scottish history and society.
In 1994 he returned to STV as a weather presenter on the station's lunchtime show. In 1995 he succeeded Bernard Ponsonby as the presenter of Trial By Night, a late night debate show.
In 1996 he was producer/director on the Scottish Reporters series and co-produced The Professional Beggar for ITV First Tuesday. Quinan was an elected official of the National Union of Journalists and was involved in the work to rule dispute at the station. In 1998, he left STV after an acrimonious contract dispute. From 1998-99 Quinan worked as for Channel 4 News, UTV and RTE as a presenter/director.

Political career[edit]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
In 1999 he was elected to represent the West of Scotland as an SNP candidate at the first Scottish Parliament election.
During his time as an MSP, he served as the SNP's Deputy spokesperson for Social Inclusion 1999-2000, a member of the European Committee and the Audit Committee.[2] He also served as Convener of the Cross Party Group on Autism in the Scottish Parliament, Vice-Convener of the Cross Party Group on Contemporary Music and was a member of the Cross Party Groups on Palestine and Cuba.[2]An active anti-nuclear campaigner, Quinan was twice arrested for breach of the peace during blockades of the Faslane Nuclear Submarine base during his time as an MSP.[3][4] Quinan went on to challenge his conviction in the High Court of Justiciary introducing a point of law which resulted in one of his convictions being set aside, this was seen as a minor victory for the anti-nuclear movement in Scotland.
In 2002, while a vice-convener of the Scottish Parliament's cross-party group on Palestine, Quinan visited the Middle East on a week-long tour, linking with the Red Crescent and International Solidarity Movement.[5] Quinan travelled to the West Bank as part of a group, but Israelis soldiers denied them entrance to Yasser Arafat's compound in Ramallah.[6] The Israeli security forces shot at him and fired stun grenades in order to force him away.[6]For the 2003 Parliament election Quinan stood down from being a candidate in the West of Scotland, and instead sought nomination in his home city of Edinburgh. Quinan was unsuccessful in his bid, and went on to unsuccessfully contest the seat of Motherwell and Wishaw at the 2003 election. The seat was held by the Labour candidate, First Minister Jack McConnell.

After Parliament[edit]
In December 2003 Quinan left the SNP for the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP), explaining that he felt the SNP no longer represented his political beliefs.[7] Quinan subsequently unsuccessfully attempted to become one of the SSP's candidates for the 2004 European Parliament election. He left the SSP later that year.
Quinan was a 'Yes' supporter who was active during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign. At one public meeting in North Berwick where he spoke, some of his closing remarks were seized upon by sections of the No campaign. Quinan had said that Scottish people ""have an opportunity to change the lives and life chances of our children for the future"", but added that ""if you vote 'No' [and] you leave them with more of the same, then you're a bad parent.""[8]Having returned to the SNP in 2014, Quinan represented the party in the 2016 Scottish parliamentary election as a candidate for the Lothian region, but was not elected.[9]

Quinan is a Hibernian F.C. supporter.[10]

Personal detailsBornLorna Slater (1975-09-27) 27 September 1975 (age 48)Calgary, Alberta, CanadaPolitical partyScottish GreensAlma materUniversity of British ColumbiaOccupationPoliticianWebsiteLorna SlaterLorna Slater (born 27 September 1975) is a Scottish-Canadian politician, who has served as Minister for Green Skills, Circular Economy and Biodiversity in the Scottish Government since 2021. She has served as co-leader of the Scottish Greens alongside Patrick Harvie since 2019, and is one of the first Green politicians in the UK to serve as a government minister. Slater has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothian region since 2021.
Born in Alberta, Canada, Slater moved to Scotland in 2000 and worked as an engineer in the renewable energy sector. She became politically involved in the Scottish Greens and was a candidate in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, but failed to win a seat.
In 2019, Slater replaced Maggie Chapman as co-leader of the Scottish Greens in the co-leadership election. She was the candidate for the Edinburgh Northern and Leith constituency in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[1] Although she failed to win, she was elected as an additional member for the Lothian region.[2] Following a power-sharing agreement with the SNP, Slater was promoted to the Scottish Government as a junior minister in the third Sturgeon government and retained the position in the Yousaf government.

Early life and engineering career[edit]
Lorna Slater was born in Calgary in the Canadian province of Alberta.[3][4][5] She was educated at the Western Canada High School.[6] From 1993 to 2000, she attended the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where she gained a degree in electro-mechanical engineering design.[7]In 2000, a month after she was due to graduate, she purchased a one-way ticket to Glasgow and planned to travel across Europe for two years, but ended up staying in Scotland.[5] After moving there, she worked as an engineer in the renewables sector, then later as a project manager.[8][9]In 2018, she was one of three women from Scotland awarded a place on the Homeward Bound international leadership development programme and this included a trip to Antarctica the following year, where she studied the effects of climate change.[10][11][12]
Early political career[edit]
Slater became politically involved during the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, where she campaigned in favour of Scottish independence.[13]Slater has been an election candidate for the Scottish Greens several times. At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the party named her third on the Lothian list,[14] while in 2017 general election, she was one of only three candidates fielded by the Scottish Greens,[9] standing for Edinburgh North and Leith.[15]In April 2019, in a City of Edinburgh Council by-election for the Leith Walk ward, she took a 25.5 per cent share of first preference votes, finishing second.[16] She was co-convener of the Scottish Greens Operations Committee when she was named second on the list of the party's candidates for the 2019 European Parliament election.[17]Also in 2019, Slater came third in the selection for the Green Party's Lothian list. Alison Johnstone won 191 first votes, Andy Wightman 133 votes and Slater 36 votes.[citation needed]
Co-leader of the Scottish Greens[edit]
Co-leadership election bid[edit]
Changes to the Scottish Greens' constitution meant the positions of co-conveners were abolished in favour of the newly established positions of co-leaders. In the run up to the 2019 Scottish Greens co-leadership election, Slater announced her candidacy via Twitter. When announcing her candidacy, she stated that the party was ready for a ""fresh new start."" Upon winning, she said that she wanted to get more women and non-binary people elected, and to gain more seats than ever before at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[10]On 1 August 2019, the results were announced and Slater replaced Maggie Chapman as the female co-leader (formerly co-convenor). She gained 30.2%, coming second place. She is serving alongside Patrick Harvie for a two-year term.[10] As Slater was not a member of the Scottish Parliament, Alison Johnstone served as co-leader of the Scottish Greens within the Scottish Parliament, until the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.

2021 election campaign[edit]
Slater at Stop Cambo Rally, July 2021Slater became a prominent figure in the lead up to the Scottish parliamentary election, with her being featured in TV Debates and interviews. In the first televised debate on BBC Scotland, Slater urged action on climate change, stating; ""Science tells us we have less than 10 years before the climate breakdown goes past the point of no return. The time to act is now."" She also reinstated how the Scottish Greens would support legislation on another referendum on Scottish independence within the ""next term of parliament"".[18]In the 2021 election to the 6th Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Greens saw their best result ever. The party gained 8.1% of votes on the regional list, earning two additional seats. As the Scottish National Party was one seat away from a majority, the Greens' gain in the election created a pro-independence majority. Slater predicted the Greens ""will have more influence than ever"".[19]
Member of the Scottish Parliament; 2021 to present[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2021Slater stood as the Greens' candidate for the Edinburgh Northern and Leith constituency in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. She gained 13.1% of the votes, but failed to win the seat, coming third.[1] Although Slater was unsuccessful in winning the constituency, she was second on the party list vote for the Lothian region, and was elected as an additional member.[2]Slater is a member of the Scottish Parliament's Economy and Fair Work Committee.[20] She is the Scottish Greens' Spokesperson on Economic Recovery and Green Industrial Strategy.[20]
Maiden speech[edit]
Slater delivering her maiden speech to the Scottish Parliament, May 2021On 18 May 2021, Slater delivered her maiden speech to the Scottish Parliament. She called on all the parties to ""work constructively and across party lines"" to make transformative change. She also called on for the parliament to build a case for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom and believes the nation should vote again in another independence referendum.[21]
We can take many of these steps now, without waiting for independence. But completing the necessary transformation must also involve asking the people of Scotland to choose their own future and building the case for independence which is based on transformation, on building the Scotland we want to see. A fair and green Scotland that is in charge of its own destiny.
COVID-19 rules breach[edit]
On 10 June 2021, a picture was shared on social media which showed Slater and other members of the Greens, including co-leader Patrick Harvie and MSP for West Scotland Ross Greer, breaching social distancing measures. At the time only three households were allowed meet indoors. However, The Scottish Sun reported that Slater, Harvie, Greer and another Green Party member were pictured at a bar in Edinburgh. Slater responded, ""This was an honest mistake, we're kicking ourselves and we apologise unreservedly"".[22]
(From left to right) Patrick Harvie; Nicola Sturgeon and Slater outside Bute House following the SNP-Greens co-operation agreement, 2021Bute House Agreement[edit]
In August 2021 after weeks of talks, she was at Bute House with co-leader Patrick Harvie and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to announce a power-sharing agreement that would see the Green party in government for the first time in the United Kingdom. There was no agreement on oil and gas exploration. As part of the agreement the Green Party would have two ministers in government.[23]
Junior minister; 2021 to present[edit]
On 30 August 2021, Slater was appointed as a junior minister in the Scottish Government as Minister for Green Skills, Circular Economy and Biodiversity. She and Harvie are the first Green Party politicians in both Scottish and UK political history to serve in government.[24]She was re-appointed as a minister after Green MSPs supported the nomination of Humza Yousaf as First Minister.[25][26]Slater joined First Minister Humza Yousaf and Minister for Independence Jamie Hepburn to launch the Scottish government's proposal for how citizenship would work in an independent Scotland in July 2023.[27][28]
Slater (second from top left), at the Scottish Cabinet meeting in Haddington, December 2023In December 2023, she joined the Traveling Cabinet in Haddington, East Lothian.[29] She then took part in a question and answer session with local residents with the Scottish Cabinet. It has been reported she attended that Cabinet meeting and other emergency Cabinet meetings as part of efforts to finalize the Scottish budget and get agreement between the Greens and SNP.[30]
Deposit Return Scheme[edit]
In November 2021 Slater announced that a flagship recycling scheme for drinks containers had been delayed yet again. Although prior to her election Slater had told voters the scheme ""needs doing"", in government she said it was proving too tricky. Greenpeace said such, ""a shambolic delay to the long awaited deposit return scheme is embarrassing for a government which loves to shout about its green credentials.""[31]
Slater and Humza Yousaf meeting business stakeholders in Scotland's Deposit Return Scheme, April 2023On 18 April 2023, the First Minister, Humza Yousaf announced the scheme would be delayed until March 2024, while the Scottish Government awaited an exemption for the scheme from the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020.[32][33] Subsequently, after the UK Government decision to provide a partial exemption from the Act, Slater announced that the scheme would be delayed ""until October 2025 at the earliest"" and said that the UK Government ""sadly seemed so far more intent on sabotaging this parliament than protecting our environment.""[34][35] Circularity Scotland, the body set up to deliver the scheme said it was ""disappointed"" by Slater's decision.[36]After delaying the scheme, she was subject to a vote of no confidence in Parliament, with the Conservatives accusing Slater of being ""out of her depth"".[37] During the No Confidence debate, Humza Yousaf described the motion as a 'stunt' to distract from the report on Boris Johnson, a perspective shared by Slater herself, who had earlier called the motion ""a shameless political stunt.""[38] The motion was defeated by 68 votes to 55 resulting in Slater surviving the vote and remaining as a junior minister.[38]
Biodiversity[edit]
Slater, with representatives from NatureScot and Friends of Saughton Park, launching a biodiversity consultation, September 2023Slater launched a consultation on the Scottish Government's biodiversity framework in September 2023.[39] Part of it, the biodiversity strategy had previously been delayed to allow for further development, which led to criticism from the Scottish Conservatives[40] It proposes to halt the decline of biodiversity and create a “nature-positive” Scotland by 2030.[41]
Marine conversation campaigners had criticised the strategy as a ""paper exercise in delay"".[42] Slater disagreed, calling the criticism a ""disappointing portrayal …[that] we neither recognise nor accept.""[42]Slater with Humza Yousaf and others at the launch of the Scottish Government's plan for citizenship in an independent Scotland, July 2023National Parks[edit]
In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election campaign, Slater's fellow co-leader, Patrick Harvie proposed two new national parks for Scotland. After the election, she gained the ministerial portfolio for national parks, and outlined the process for selecting one or more new national parks.[43] In October 2023, Slater reaffirmed the promise to create at least two new national parks.[44]
Circular Economy[edit]
The Circular Economy Bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament by Slater in June 2023.[45] Slater argues the bill targets “lazy, anti-social behaviour” and the country’s growing “throw away culture” by introducing further regulation on waste disposal.[45][46] Slater's proposals were welcomed by Friends of the Earth Scotland.[47] The Bill is currently undergoing stage one scrutiny by the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee who criticised the ""entirely unrealistic"" costings that accompany the bill.[48]
Slater was criticised for avoiding questions from MSPs about the Bill by some commentators.[49] Some campaigners have advocated for the Slater to go further, and include provision for education about the circular economy.[50]
Personal life[edit]
Slater is autistic and has tweeted about this.[51] She is also a hobby aerialist[52] and has a pet bearded dragon called Bellamy, named after David Bellamy.[53]

Personal detailsBorn (1979-06-27) 27 June 1979 (age 44)Salisbury, Zimbabwe Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe)Political partyScottish GreensAlma materUniversity of EdinburghStirling UniversityProfessionTeacherWebsitewww.maggiechapman.scotMaggie Chapman (born 27 June 1979) is a Scottish politician and lecturer[1] who is a Scottish Green Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for North East Scotland. She was co-convenor of the Scottish Greens from November 2013 to August 2019, serving with Patrick Harvie, and was the party's lead candidate for the 2019 European election.[2]She was a councillor for the Leith Walk ward of The City of Edinburgh Council from 2007 to 2015 and represented the Scottish Greens on the Smith Commission for further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament.
Chapman was the Rector of the University of Aberdeen, having been elected in 2014, and again in 2018. Her term ended on the 31 March 2021.
She was the lead Green candidate for the North East region at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, and was elected as one of eight Green MSPs.[3]
Early life and education[edit]
Chapman was born in 1979 in Salisbury, Zimbabwe Rhodesia.[4] Her family had moved from South Africa in 1978 for her father to take up the post of director at the college of music.[4][5] She grew up there, educated at a mixed-race school, with the country having achieved independence from the United Kingdom as the Republic of Zimbabwe whilst she was a baby.[4] Her mother was a nurse who worked as a theatre sister and midwife.[4]Chapman moved to Scotland to study Zoology at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 2001.[6] She went on to complete a Master's degree in Environmental Management at the University of Stirling in 2003, then returned to Edinburgh University to study for a PhD in Geography.[6][7] In 2015, she clarified that she had not completed her doctoral studies.[8] As a student, she had been an activist for Edinburgh University Students' Association.[9][10]
Professional life[edit]
Chapman has worked in the west of Scotland in Environmental Management, and as a community carer throughout Edinburgh.[11][12]Until June 2015 she was a lecturer in cultural geography, environmental ethics and social justice at Edinburgh Napier University.[5] She retains a role in teaching through her support for the Educational Institute of Scotland.[13]In mid-2015 she took up a post at the Muslim Women's Resource Centre in Dundee.[14]
Political career[edit]
Chapman was first elected as a councillor for the Leith Walk ward in the 2007 City of Edinburgh Council election, becoming one of the three first Green councillors in Edinburgh. She was re-elected in 2012.[15] Later that year she became the first ever convener of the council's Petitions Committee.[16] During her time as a councillor, Chapman has advocated for causes that include: the living wage, participatory budgeting, better private tenancy rights,[17] and better support for non-profits.[18] She has also organised and voted against the privatisation of council services and cuts to services.[19] In June 2015, she announced she was standing down as a councillor, to concentrate on the Scottish Parliament election that was to be held in May 2016.[14] She was selected as the party's lead candidate for the North East region.[20]In November 2013, she was elected unopposed as the Scottish Greens' female co-convenor, succeeding Glasgow councillor Martha Wardrop,[21] and was re-elected to the position in 2016.[20][22]Chapman was the party's lead candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom for the Scotland constituency.[23][24] She was not elected.
Chapman is a socialist, environmentalist, anti-cuts activist, peace activist and feminist. She has been active in a number of political campaigns, including the Radical Independence Campaign.[25][26]In September 2014, Chapman became a member of the Smith Commission into further devolution for the Scottish Parliament.[27]In 2015, Maggie Chapman was challenged as co-convenor by activist Zara Kitson in the party's internal elections. Kitson was second on the party list for Glasgow in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election and was nominated by former MSP Mark Ruskell and endorsed by MSP and former convenor Alison Johnstone. The election was notable as it was the first time an incumbent co-convenor faced a serious challenge, all to date had been re-elected as the sole nominees.
She stood in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election as the party's lead candidate for the North East region but despite the Greens increasing their number of MSPs from two to six, Chapman was not elected.[28]In 2019, she was once again selected as the party's lead candidate for the European Parliament election for the Scotland constituency.[29] She was not elected.[30]At the 2019 Scottish Green leadership election, Chapman lost to Lorna Slater.[31]In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Chapman lead the North East regional list for the Scottish Greens.[3] Her successful election to Holyrood was announced on 8 May 2021, two days after the election.[32] This made her the first Green MSP in the North East since Shiona Baird lost her seat in 2007.[33] Upon being sworn in, Chapman repeated her affirmation in Shona.[34]
Rector[edit]
In November 2014, she was elected as Rector of the University of Aberdeen after a vote by the student body of the University.[35] She was installed as rector at a ceremony in March 2015, having intimated that she would be active in the role.[36]Chapman ran for a second term in November 2017, but the election was annulled after allegations that her supporters had torn down posters belonging to rival candidates, which Chapman and her campaign team denied. A document released by the University indicated that the election committee disagreed with the initial decision to annul the results as Chapman had not been given a right of reply to the allegations but did not overturn it. In the end, the election was re-run in February 2018. Chapman won re-election, defeating Aberdeen law student Israr Khan by a margin of 1,248 votes to 891.[37]
Controversies[edit]
2016 North East Scotland selection[edit]
The party's selection process of co-convenor Maggie Chapman as lead candidate in the North East Scotland region for the 2016 election attracted controversy. After she won selection by local members in late 2015, some members started a petition calling for her de-selection and replacement with a local candidate, whose signatures included fellow list candidates Green councillor Martin Ford and former Green councillor Debra Storr, as well as former Green MSP Shiona Baird. Then, allegations emerged of ballot irregularities in the selection process, although they were dismissed by the party's Elections and Campaigns Committee. There was also controversy around claims Chapman had pretended to have a doctorate, although the party claimed it was an administrative error.
The Scottish Green Party national council ruled that the ballot result was the ""settled will of the party"" and told Ford and Storr to cease contesting it or resign as candidates. Both chose to resign both as candidates and party members.

Failure to declare financial interest[edit]
On 10 May 2023, Chapman was sanctioned after the standards committee found she had failed to declare a financial interest during an evidence session on the Gender Recognition Reform Bill.[38]
Response to 2023 Hamas attack on Israel[edit]
In October 2023, Chapman tweeted that Hamas attack on Israel which killed 1,300 and took more hostage was ""decolonisation"", not ""terrorism"". She later deleted her posts after facing criticism and said that she did not support the initial statement.[39]
Personal life[edit]
Her father, Neil Chapman, was a professional classical musician.[40] She has a sister, Catherine.[40] She plays the fiddle and enjoys exploring Scotland.[41]

Personal detailsBorn (1949-03-07) 7 March 1949 (age 74)Edinburgh, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Labour PartyAlma materUniversity of EdinburghMalcolm George Richardson Chisholm (born 7 March 1949) is a Scottish politician who served as Minister for Health and Community Care from 2001 to 2004 and Minister for Communities from 2004 to 2006. A member of the Scottish Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburgh North and Leith, formerly Edinburgh Leith, from 1992 to 2001 and Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the equivalent seat and its successor from 1999 to 2016.

Career[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011Chisholm was Member of Parliament for Edinburgh Leith from 1992, then Edinburgh North and Leith from 1997. He served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland responsible for local government and transport minister for a few months in 1997; but resigned over single parent benefit cuts. He remained an MP until 2001, when he stood down from the House of Commons in order to concentrate on the Scottish Parliament, to which he was elected in 1999 for the same constituency.
Chisholm became Minister for Health and Community Care in 2001, then Minister for Communities from October 2004. As Minister for Health and Community Care, he introduced and oversaw the passage of the National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Bill[1] which brought about the abolition of NHS Trusts in Scotland and the creation of Community Health Partnerships.[2]As Minister for Communities, Chisholm oversaw investment in the building of affordable homes,[3][4] approved a proposal from Fife Council for a moratorium on council house sales in order to maintain the supply of affordable housing,[5] developed reforms of planning policy to protect green spaces,[6] and extended the Central Heating Programme and Warm Deal to provide and refurbish heating systems for pensioners.[7]In December 2006, Chisholm criticised the decision to renew Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent, in opposition to First Minister Jack McConnell, leading to speculation that Chisholm might be removed from office.[8] He subsequently resigned on 21 December 2006 after supporting a motion passed by the Scottish National Party that opposed the replacement of the nuclear submarines.[9]On 17 September 2007, Chisholm was appointed Shadow Minister for Culture and External Affairs by new Scottish Labour leader, Wendy Alexander. In September 2008, Chisholm returned to the backbenches.
In April 2014, Chrisholm announced his intent to stand down at the 2016 election, with Lesley Hinds replacing him as Labour candidate in the Edinburgh Northern and Leith seat.[10]

Biagi won the seat of Edinburgh Central in the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections, defeating the Labour incumbent Sarah Boyack by a narrow margin of 237 votes but achieving only the second lowest share of the vote of any successful SNP constituency candidate.[6] He is understood to be the youngest person to have won election to the Scottish Parliament in a constituency seat.[5] When he was sworn in as an MSP he took the oath in his native English and also Italian.[7]His maiden speech was in praise of renewable energy on 2 June 2011[8] followed by staging the first Member's Debate of the parliamentary term on 8 June in support of the campaign for the UK Green Investment Bank to be situated in Edinburgh.[9] Although the campaign was successful, Biagi changed to a more critical stance when it emerged that the majority of staff were nonetheless based in London rather than his constituency.[10]Biagi has also been a persistent critic[11][12][13] of the Edinburgh tram project, which runs through Edinburgh Central, and which he described as ""an overpriced downgrade"" after suggestions that it would have a longer journey time than the existing airport bus.[14]He publicly supported the retention of the SNP's policy of non-NATO membership in 2012 against a change proposed by the party's leadership,[15][16] a stance which the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives suggested resulted in him being passed over for promotion as a Minister that autumn.[17] After Jean Urquhart resigned from the SNP over the NATO policy change Biagi replaced her as Deputy Convener of the Scottish Parliament's Equal Opportunities Committee in October 2012.[18]In 2013 Biagi laid amendments to the Post-16 Education (Scotland) Bill to create duties on agencies including the Scottish Funding Council to support widening access to further and higher education, which were passed by Parliament with Scottish Government support.[19] Shortly after he was elected as Honorary President of the Federation of Student Nationalists.[20]Openly gay since before he was elected,[21] for his contributions in support of the passage of Scotland's same-sex marriage bill Biagi was named on the inaugural Scotland on Sunday Pink List of 50 influential LGBT Scots in 2014.[22]Biagi joined the Scottish Government as Minister for Local Government and Community Empowerment in November 2014.[23] While in this role, in February 2015, he was appointed as co-chair of the Commission on Local Tax Reform – a cross-party group set up by the Scottish Government, tasked with examining alternatives to the Council Tax.[24]
After Parliament[edit]
Biagi began a PhD in political science at Yale University in the autumn of 2016, studying comparative politics.
In 2020 he sought a return to elected politics and put himself forward for selection as the SNP's candidate for Edinburgh Central. Party members chose Angus Robertson as their candidate instead.[25]In 2020 he started work at SNP HQ to lead the party's independence task force as a consultant. However, in 2021 he quit, posting on social media that, ""the best job offer I've ever had turn out to be worst job I've ever had"". He added that he was disappointed that SNP members in Edinburgh Central had decided they would, ""rather have a pompous impressionable idiot than me"".[26]He was elected as a local councillor for the Colinton/Fairmilehead ward in The City of Edinburgh Council election on 5 May 2022.[27]

Personal detailsBornMargaret Patricia Curran (1958-11-24) 24 November 1958 (age 65)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyLabourSpouseRab MurrayChildren2Alma materUniversity of GlasgowMargaret Patricia Curran (born 24 November 1958) is a Scottish Labour Party politician. She served in the British House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow East from 2010 to 2015 and was Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland from 2011 until 2015. She was previously the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Baillieston from 1999 to 2011, and held a number of posts within the Scottish Executive, including Minister for Parliamentary Business, Minister for Social Justice and Minister for Communities.

Early life and education[edit]
Curran was born in Glasgow, the daughter of Irish parents James Curran and Rose McConnellogue.[2][3] She was educated at Our Lady and St Francis School in Glasgow.
Curran attended the University of Glasgow, where she graduated with an MA degree in History and Economic History in 1981. She first became politically active in the university's Labour Club in the late 1970s, where she was associated with future Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont and future Labour MSP Sarah Boyack. She held several posts in Labour student politics, including secretary and vice-chair of Glasgow University Labour Club, and chair and secretary of the Scottish Organisation of Labour Students. In 1977, she was involved in the unsuccessful campaign to elect Hortensia Allende, the former First Lady of Chile, as Rector of the University of Glasgow.
She was a community worker, and then a lecturer in community education at the University of Strathclyde, a subject she holds a Certificate in.[3] Curran was Mohammad Sarwar's election agent at Glasgow Govan for the 1997 general election. In 2021, Sarwar's son Anas became Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.

Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
In 1999 Curran was elected to the new Scottish Parliament, and was promoted to a junior minister when Henry McLeish became First Minister and later became a member of the Scottish Executive.[4] She served as convenor of the Social Inclusion committee, then was promoted to Deputy Minister for Social Justice. She then rose to become minister in that portfolio, which later changed to Minister for Communities, introducing the Homelessness (Scotland) Bill[5] in September 2002. She held the position of Minister for Parliamentary Business from 2004 until 2007.
She was re-elected comfortably in 2003 and again in 2007. Given Scottish Labour's losses in that later election, she was widely viewed as a popular potential successor to Jack McConnell as its leader, but decided not to stand against Wendy Alexander. Curran pledged her support to Iain Gray who was standing against Cathy Jamieson and Andy Kerr. Iain Gray was voted Scottish Labour Party Leader and appointed Curran to manage the party's 2011 election manifesto.[6] She stood down as MSP for Glasgow Baillieston at the 2011 Scottish election.

2008 Glasgow East by-election[edit]
Main article: 2008 Glasgow East by-election
On 30 June 2008, David Marshall, MP for Glasgow East, resigned from the House of Commons on grounds of ill health, triggering a by-election.[7] The Labour candidate for the by-election was to have been announced on 4 July,[8] though the announcement was postponed when the likely choice, local councillor George Ryan, chose to withdraw from the nomination process.[9] On 5 July, Curran placed herself forward for nomination on the Labour Party's shortlist and was confirmed as their candidate on 7 July.[10][11] The by-election took place on 24 July 2008 and Curran was defeated by John Mason of the Scottish National Party by 365 votes.[12] The swing from Labour was 22.54%.

Member of Parliament[edit]
At the 2010 general election, Curran regained Glasgow East for Labour from the Scottish National Party. After her electoral victory was announced, she walked out with the other candidates from the platform, refusing to make a speech whilst sharing the platform with the British National Party candidate. From 2010 to 2011, she was Shadow Minister for Disabled People.[13][14]On 7 October 2011, in a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, Labour Party leader Ed Miliband sacked Ann McKechin and appointed Curran as her replacement for Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland.[6]Willie Bain, then-MP for Glasgow North East, also became Curran's new deputy as Shadow Scotland Office Minister, replacing Tom Greatrex.[15]At the 2015 general election, she lost her seat to Natalie McGarry of the Scottish National Party. This was a  landslide defeat for Scottish Labour; who lost forty of the forty-one seats they were defending, and were reduced to a single MP at Westminster, with the SNP elected in 56 of Scotland's 59 seats. With many veteran Labour politicians losing their seats, including: then-Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander and then-Scottish Labour Party Leader, Jim Murphy. Presenting speeches following their constituency's declaration, Curran declined to speak following the announcement of her own defeat.

Views on Alex Salmond[edit]
Curran was known to have a particularly difficult relationship with SNP leader Alex Salmond. In 2012, Curran accused Salmond and his government of having a ""culture of casual dishonesty"",[16] and suggested his ""blokeish attitude"" made him a liability among women in Scotland during the Scottish independence referendum campaign.[17] In November 2011, she told Holyrood magazine[18] that were Salmond to be killed by being run over by a bus, she would have no interest in finding out who the driver was.[19] In April 2014, she dismissed Salmond's appeal to female voters, saying ""Women will see through his cynical attempts to win them over"" and described a speech he made as ""drivel"".[20] Speaking about a work programme whilst in Dundee, Curran stated ""Every time I'm in Dundee people have raised their disappointment with the former First Minister over his promise. Renewable energy is a sector Dundee badly needs and the city has been let down badly by his retreat from promise. I think Alex Salmond should apologise to the people of Dundee"". These comments related to the fact that only 15% of Work Programme participants had proceeded to find a job.[21]
Personal life[edit]
She and her husband Robert ""Rab"" Murray live in Glasgow with their two sons. Curran listed her recreations in Who's Who as ""reading, theatre, American politics"" and ""spending time with my sons"".[3]

Political career[edit]
From 1988 to 1996, she was a member and Conservative Group Leader of Hamilton District Council, and from 1999 to 2002 was a special advisor to Scottish Conservatives Leader David McLetchie MSP and James Douglas-Hamilton MSP.[1]In the Scottish election on 3 May 2007, she failed in her bid to win the Hamilton South constituency, being defeated by Labour's Tom McCabe. However, she was elected as a regional member for the Central Scotland region.

""By the end of this session in 2021 I will have had the privilege of representing my Central Scotland constituents for 18 years and I thank you all for your support,"" she said. ""However at the end of last year I made the huge decision that, having achieved most of the things I set out to do, I would not seek re-election in 2021. In doing so I am re-assured that I leave my party's representation both at local government and parliamentary level in a much better place.[4]

Early career[edit]
Before entering politics, McNair spent 14 years working as a nurse at St Margaret of Scotland Hospice in Clydebank.[3]
Political career[edit]
Initially a member of the Labour Party, McNair was elected as a councillor for the Clydebank Waterfront ward at the 2003 Scottish local elections.[3] She was re-elected in 2007, but quit the party in November 2008 to stand as an independent. In her resignation letter, she said: ""There is a ruling clique that ignores views expressed that they don't agree with and their style of leadership has intimidation at its core. These are all issues that have been raised within the party at all levels to no avail. I feel strongly that I can better express and stand up for the views of my constituents when free from the restraints of the Labour Group's ruling clique.""[4]After being re-relected as an independent candidate in 2012 and voting Yes in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum,[5] McNair defected to the SNP in January 2016[6] and was elected in Clydebank Waterfront for a fifth time in 2017.[1]In October 2020, she was part of an all-woman shortlist to replace the retiring Gil Paterson as MSP for Clydebank and Milngavie,[1] and was chosen as the candidate the following month.[7] At the election, she was elected with a slightly reduced majority.[8]

Personal detailsBorn (1971-06-27) 27 June 1971 (age 52)Leeds, EnglandPolitical partyScottish Green PartyAlma materUniversity of EdinburghMark Ballard (born 27 June 1971) is a former Scottish Green Party politician.  He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothians region from 2003 to 2007, and co-convener of the Edinburgh Green Party from 2007 to 2010.  He was Lord Rector of the University of Edinburgh from 2006 to 2009, and now works for the children's charity Children 1st.

Early life[edit]
Ballard was born in Leeds, England on 27 June 1971. During his childhood he lived in Punjab, India (1973–1975) and Islamabad, Pakistan (1984–1985).[1]
Education and early career[edit]
He attended Lawnswood School in Leeds before going on to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with an MA (Hons) in Economic and Social History.[2] He is a life member of the Edinburgh University Union, part of the Edinburgh University Students Association (EUSA).[3]Between 1994 and 1998 he worked for European Youth Forest Action (now European Youth For Action) in Edinburgh and Amsterdam. From 1999 until 2001 he worked as editor of the journal Reforesting Scotland before setting up an environmental communications consultancy company that ran until 2003.[1][4]
Political career[edit]
He joined the youth wing of the Labour Party when he was 15 and remained a member until 1991. At this point he became involved in the Scottish Green Party's student movement. He ran as a candidate for this party in the 1995 council elections, the 1999 Scottish Parliamentary election[5] and a 2001 council by-election. He was first elected in the 2003 Holyrood election, as the second Green MSP in the Lothians.[6]He was a member of the Scottish Parliament Finance Committee[7] and was also substitute member of the Enterprise and Culture Committee.[2] He committed substantial time to promoting social enterprises and co-operatives, as a Green alternative to the current system.[8] He also used the position to call for sustainable procurement guidelines, support ethical investment campaigns, and make the case for Scottish utilities being in public ownership.
As the Green speaker on Transport, Ballard supported campaigns against the Dalkeith by-pass and the M74, for the trams in Edinburgh and for a better and cheaper public transport system.[9] As a Lothians MSP he helped raise awareness of community initiatives such as the campaign to resist a huge superstore development in Portobello, supporting the calls for congestion charging in Edinburgh, assisting universities wanting to make the switch to Fairtrade and opposing tuition fees for students. The latter in particular helped him win support amongst Edinburgh's student community.

Campaigning work[edit]
Ballard has also been involved in direct action campaigning, most notably against British nuclear weapons on the River Clyde at Faslane.[10] He was arrested at Faslane several times, as part of the CND 'Big Blockade', and in August 2004 he and three other MSPs were among dozens of protesters arrested.[11] He was involved in a long-running court case over the destruction of a field of rapeseed at the Roslin Institute near Dalkeith in 1999.[12] Although initially found guilty of ""wilfully and recklessly"" destroying plants belonging to Monsanto Company,[13] all charges were quashed due to a delay in the hearing of the appeal, which Mr Ballard claimed was because the Crown was unable to provide relevant evidence.[14][15]Ballard's Parliamentary Register of Interests indicated that he held membership of several organisations, including:[3]Friends of the Earth, Sustrans, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Democratic Left Scotland, Reforesting Scotland, Water of Leith Conservation Trust, Friends of Inverleith Park, SSPCA, Advocates for Animals and Scottish Education and Action for Development. Until 2005 he was also an unpaid director of UK charity Seeds for Change,[16] treasurer of the Scottish Environmental Festivals association and is on the editorial board of the Scottish Left Review, a bi-monthly cross-party journal of the Scottish left.

Rector of the University of Edinburgh[edit]
In February 2006 he stood for election as Rector the University of Edinburgh standing against MP for Henley Boris Johnson, pro-Palestine journalist John Pilger and former Scotsman editor Magnus Linklater. The profile of the Rectorial election had been raised by Johnson's candidature.[17][18]The election took place on 15 and 16 February 2006, with a record turn out of almost 8000.[4] A system of Single Transferable Vote was used. In the final round Mark Ballard received 3,597 votes against Magnus Linklater's 3,052 and was elected.[19][20]He was formally installed on 9 June 2006 in a ceremony in the university's Old College. Present at this ceremony were the Chancellor of the university, HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the University Vice-Chancellor and Principal, Professor Timothy O'Shea, and Mark Ballard's predecessor as Rector, Labour MP Tam Dalyell.[21] In this capacity he worked on issues of concern to students and university staff, including playing a prominent role in the movement which led to the complete abolishing of student tuition fees in Scotland in 2008.[22]He was succeeded as Rector in 2009 by journalist Iain Macwhirter, whose campaign drew on many of Ballard's supporters.

Career after Parliament[edit]
After the 2007 election, Ballard became head of communications at the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations,[23] then was assistant director of Barnardo's in Scotland for eight years, before becoming Director of Strategy at Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland. In November 2017, he became Head of Save the Children in Scotland.[24][25] He currently works for the children's charity Children 1st.

Personal life[edit]
Ballard has two children.[25]

He is married to Stephanie and has three children.

Early life and career[edit]

Griffin is a trained Mechanical Engineer and prior to his election to North Lanarkshire Council in 2008, he was a serving soldier in the British Territorial Army (TA).[1]
Political career[edit]
Having served as a North Lanarkshire Councillor from 2008 until 2012 (serving the multi-member Kilsyth ward), Griffin was elected on the Central Scotland regional list at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.[2]In May 2012, Griffin was appointed Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Sport. He held the role until July 2013, when he became Shadow Minister for Transport and Veterans.[citation needed] When Jim Murphy was elected Scottish Labour Party leader in December 2014, Griffin was appointed as Shadow Minister for Learning, Science and Scotland's Languages, covering school education, qualifications, science, HM Inspectorate of Education, the Scottish Qualifications Authority and languages.[citation needed]Upon his election at the age of 25, Griffin became the youngest Member of the Scottish Parliament since its establishment in 1999.[3] Following the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, this record was taken by 21-year-old Ross Greer, who was elected for the Scottish Green Party.[4]Griffin became one of the first MSPs elected in 2011 to put forward plans for a Members Bill.

I do not have confidence in your ability, after three years in post, to turn the situation around. I hope you will consider resigning from your position as leader in the best interests of the Scottish Labour Party.""[8]Griffin nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[9]

McDonald issued an apology on 6 March 2018, announcing he had now left the SNP and would sit in the Scottish Parliament as an Independent.[4][5]
Education and early career[edit]
McDonald was educated at Dyce Primary School and Dyce Academy. He gained an MA in Politics from the University of Dundee (2002) and an MLitt in Strategic Studies from the University of Aberdeen (2003). From 2003 to 2011 he worked as a Parliamentary Assistant to MSPs Richard Lochhead, Maureen Watt, and Nigel Don. In 2004, he unsuccessfully contested a Local Authority by-election. He stood as the SNP candidate for Aberdeen South in the 2010 UK general election coming fourth in the poll.

Political career[edit]
Aberdeen City Council[edit]
McDonald was elected to Aberdeen City Council in 2007 at the age of 26 representing the Dyce/Bucksburn/Danestone ward. Twelve days later his colleagues elected him as vice-convener of the housing and environment committee and he was appointed the deputy leader of the SNP group on the council.[6]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
McDonald was elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2011 election from the North East Scotland regional list[7] with the SNP taking 52.71% of the vote. As the Scottish National Party had already won all ten constituency seats in the region, it came as a surprise to McDonald, who famously appeared at the declaration wearing jeans and a T-shirt.[7] He made his maiden speech on 2 June 2011 during a debate on Green Energy. McDonald has been a member of many committees in the parliament, but most recently sat on the Finance Committee and the Devolution & Further Powers Committee. In addition, he served on a number of Cross Party Groups (CPGs) including Oil & Gas, Carers, Epilepsy and Mental Health (which he co-convenes). He served as a Parliamentary Liaison Officer to the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney having previously been Parliamentary Liaison Officer to Alex Salmond during his tenure as First Minister.
In September 2011, McDonald announced he was to bring forward a Member's Bill on High Hedge Disputes,[8] which was passed unanimously by the Scottish Parliament on 28 March 2013,[9] making McDonald's bill the first Members' Bill to pass in the Parliamentary session.
McDonald has been a keen advocate for individuals on the autistic spectrum, leading members debates on the issue and asking questions of the Scottish Government. He has been a member of the Scotland Advisory Committee of the National Autistic Society and a trustee of the charity, Friendly Access, which looks to create a more accessible environment for individuals with sensory disabilities.
Following the death of Brian Adam in April 2013, Mark McDonald was selected as the SNP candidate for Aberdeen Donside and resigned his seat as a North East Scotland Region MSP to fight the by-election.[10] McDonald held the seat for the SNP with a reduced majority and was returned to the Scottish Parliament on 20 June 2013.[11]In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, McDonald contested the seat and was successfully re-elected winning 56% of the vote and increasing the SNP majority to 11,630 – the largest majority in the whole of Scotland.

Scottish Government[edit]
Following the Scottish Government reshuffle on 18 May 2016, McDonald was appointed to serve as Minister for Childcare & Early Years.
In March 2020, McDonald announced his plans to step down from parliament at the 2021 election.

Resignation from the SNP[edit]
McDonald tendered his resignation as minister on 4 November 2017 following the announcement by the SNP that he was being investigated for misconduct in the wake of the 2017 Westminster sexual misconduct allegations, saying ""It has been brought to my attention that some of my previous actions have been considered to be inappropriate – where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behaviour might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions.""[3]Two weeks later, McDonald was suspended from the SNP pending an internal investigation. After that investigation substantiated the charges, McDonald announced that he had resigned from the SNP ahead of a group meeting to decide on reinstating him. However, he intended to remain at Holyrood as an independent, despite all major parties in the chamber urging him to stand down.[4]On 21 June 2018 the parliament's standards committee recommended McDonald be suspended without pay for a month.[12]

She was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) representing the constituency of Aberdeen South and North Kincardine from 2011 to 2021 when she retired, having previously served as a regional member for North East Scotland from 2006 until 2011.

Early life[edit]

Parliamentary career[edit]
Watt stood a candidate in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election but was not elected.[6] Before the term ended, Richard Lochhead resigned his seat to contest the Moray by-election. The next person on the SNP list from the 2003 election had been Alasdair Allan but he refused his place in Parliament as he had secured the SNP nomination for the Western Isles for the 2007 election. The next person on the list was Maureen Watt, who took up the place.
Watt was sworn in as MSP on 19 April 2006, becoming the first MSP to swear their oath of allegiance in Doric.[7][8]Watt made her maiden speech[9] on 20 April 2006 on the subject of Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation. With a gap of only 17 hours 25 minutes since taking the Parliamentary oath she took over the record for the shortest wait from John Scott.
After the SNP's victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, Watt was appointed as the Minister for Schools and Skills.[10] She left this office on 10 February 2009.
In May 2011, Watt was elected as SNP MSP for Aberdeen South and North Kincardine on a 15.77% swing from the Liberal Democrats.
She was Convener of the Scottish Parliament Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee from 15 June 2011.[11] On 21 November 2014 she was appointed Minister of Public Health, succeeding Michael Matheson who was promoted to the Cabinet.[12]In May 2016, Watt was re-elected for Aberdeen South and North Kincardine. On 18 May 2016 she was moved to the post of Minister for Mental Health in a reshuffle.[13]
Family[edit]
Watt is the daughter of former SNP MP (1974–1979) Hamish Watt. She is married with two children. One of them, Stuart Donaldson, served as an SNP MP for Aberdeenshire West and Kincardine in the British Parliament between 2015 and 2017.[14]

Career[edit]
Army career[edit]

Political career[edit]

He previously served in Nicola Sturgeon's cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Justice from 2014 to 2018 and as Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero, Energy and Transport[a] from 2018 to 2023.
A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 1999, first representing the Central Scotland region and, since 2007, the Falkirk West constituency.
A graduate of the Queen Margaret University and The Open University, Matheson worked as an occupational therapist in local government, before his election to Holyrood in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. He served successively as the SNP's shadow deputy minister for justice and rural development and shadow minister for culture and sport. Matheson ran unsuccessfully, twice, for the Falkirk West constituency, however, remained as an additional member for the Central Scotland region until the 2007 election, when he was third time lucky. He sat on the SNP's backbenches from 2007 until 2011, when he was appointed Minister for Public Health in First Minister Alex Salmond's second government, supporting Nicola Sturgeon, and later Alex Neil, in their role as Health Secretary. 
Following the appointment of Sturgeon as First Minister, she promoted Matheson to the Scottish Cabinet as the Justice Secretary. In a 2018 Scottish Cabinet reshuffle, he was appointed to the new post of Cabinet Secretary of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity. The office was retitled as the Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero, Energy and Transport in Sturgeon's third administration, as part of her government's effort to tackle the climate emergency.
Following Sturgeon's resignation and the appointment of Humza Yousaf as First Minister, Matheson was appointed Cabinet Secretary for NHS Recovery, Health and Social Care in 2023.

Early life[edit]
Birth and education[edit]
Michael Stephen Matheson was born on 8 September 1970 in Glasgow.[2] He was raised in the Toryglen district and educated at John Bosco Secondary School in the city. He then attended Queen Margaret University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in occupational therapy in 1991. He later went on to graduate from The Open University with both a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Postgraduate diploma in applied social sciences.[3] Following graduation, he worked as a community occupational therapist for eight years, until his election to the Scottish Parliament.

Early political career[edit]
Matheson worked for Highland Regional Council, Central Regional Council and Stirling Council. He first stood as a parliamentary candidate for the SNP in the 1997 general election, standing for the newly created Hamilton North and Bellshill constituency.

Political career[edit]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
In the 1999 Scottish parliamentary election, Matheson contested the Falkirk West constituency, which was won by the independent Dennis Canavan, who had been rejected by the Labour Party.[4] However, Matheson was ranked third on the SNP's regional list for Central Scotland and was one of the five SNP candidates elected in the region.

SNP in opposition: 1999–2007[edit]
He served as Shadow Deputy Minister for Justice from May 1999 until September 2004, and as Shadow Deputy Minister for Rural Development from October 2001 until September 2004. Matheson also served on the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Justice and Home Affairs Committee, and the Justice 1 Committee between 1999 and 2004.[5] During the 2000 SNP deputy leadership election, he was the campaign manager for Roseanna Cunningham.
He contested the Falkirk West constituency again at the 2003 Scottish parliamentary election, and although it was won again by Denis Canavan, Matheson was re-elected as one of three SNP MSPs for Central Scotland. In the parliament's second session he served on the Justice 1 Committee, the Enterprise and Culture Committee and the Justice 2 Committee. From September 2004 until September 2006, he was Shadow Minister for Culture and Sport.[6]
Backbencher: 2007–2011[edit]
Matheson won the constituency in the 2007 election with a majority of 776 votes over Labour, after Canavan stepped down.[4] (Canavan later endorsed Matheson for re-election in 2011).[4]
Matheson was a member of the Health and Sport Committee from June 2007 until March 2011 and was the Deputy Convener of the European and External Relations Committee from March 2009 until July 2010.[7] He was also a member of the End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill Committee.[7]Before becoming a Minister, Matheson was actively involved in a number of Parliamentary Cross-Party Groups, including those on Malawi, Sport, Alzheimer's disease, International development, Russia and Taiwan.
At the 2011 Scottish parliamentary election, he retained his seat with an increased majority of 5,745 votes over Labour.

Salmond Administration: 2011–2014[edit]
He was appointed as Minister for Public Health after the SNP landslide in 2011, a position he held until the November 2014 reshuffle which saw him promoted to cabinet rank as Cabinet Secretary for Justice.

Justice Secretary: 2014–2018[edit]
Following the appointment of Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister of Scotland, she appointed Matheson as the Cabinet Secretary for Justice on 21 November 2014. In Sturgeon's 2016 cabinet reshuffle, he remained in the post of Justice Secretary. Matheson was supported by the Minister for Community Safety, Paul Wheelhouse, and later, Annabelle Ewing. 

Crime and policing[edit]
Matheson supported efforts to merge British Transport Police with Police Scotland.[8] He also proposed for the criminal justice system in Scotland to move from prison towards rehabilitation in a bid to reduce re-offending rates.[9]
Criminal misconduct within police authorities[edit]
The justice system in Scotland was claimed to have been in a ""state of chaos"" amid criminal misconduct of high ranking officials in Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority.[10] The scandal erupted following the absence leave of chief constable of Police Scotland Phil Gormley, who was accused of bullying.[11] He resigned and was succeeded by his deputy Iain Livingston.[12] The chief executive and chair of governing body the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) also resigned.[13][14] In 2018, a BBC Scotland investigation raised concerns that ""bad practices and unlawful behaviour in the previous eight regional forces had continued"" after Police Scotland was established in 2013.[15]Matheson was accused of being ""invisible""[10] and ""closing down questions"" amid allegations of gross misconduct and leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, raised the possibility he may have acted unlawful.[16]Scottish Labour also claimed Matheson was unlawful after ignoring recommendations by the SPA not to allow Gormley to return from his suspension.[17]
Transport Secretary: 2018–2023[edit]
In a cabinet reshuffle in 2018, he was shifted to Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity. In 2021, his portfolio changed, with infrastructure and connectivity being replaced with net zero and energy, becoming Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero, Energy and Transport.

Health Secretary: 2023-present[edit]
Matheson endorsed Humza Yousaf in the 2023 Scottish National Party leadership election.[18] Following Yousaf's election as party leader and appointment as First Minister, Matheson was appointed Cabinet Secretary for NHS Recovery, Health and Social Care in his government.
In November 2023, Matheson was revealed to have incurred £10,935 in roaming charges after taking a Parliamentary iPad on a family holiday to Morocco. Matheson claimed that he incurred the charges while completing constituency work, and that he had not been aware that he needed to replace the SIM card in the iPad to switch over to the Scottish Parliament's current mobile contract. Matheson attempted to claim £3,000 of the bill from his expenses budget, with the Scottish Parliament paying the remainder out of its own budget.[19] First Minister Humza Yousaf described this as a ""legitimate parliamentary expense"".[20] Matheson's bill was described as being more than the total of all MSPs' mobile phone, business line, tablet and staff phone bill expenses claimed in 2022/23 combined: the total for all phone-related expenses in that year was £9,507.[21]It was subsequently revealed that Matheson had been emailed by Parliamentary officials in the February of 2022, warning him of the need to update the SIM cards in his devices almost a year in advance of his holiday. Following this, Matheson agreed to personally pay back the full cost of the data roaming bill.[21] On 16 November, Matheson admitted to the Scottish Parliament that the charges had been incurred owing to his sons using the iPad to watch football matches, and that he would refer himself to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body for investigation, but would not stand down as health secretary.[22] On 19 November, Humza Yousaf re-iterated his confidence in Matheson, describing him as a man of integrity and honesty, and insisted that he had not been misled by the health secretary over the bill.[23]
Personal life[edit]
Matheson has been married to Susan Totten since 2005.[24] They have two sons, James and Daniel, and a stepson, Sean O’Donnell. [25]

Background[edit]
Russell was born in Bromley, Kent to an English mother and a Scottish father.[4][5]
He grew up in Troon,[6] where he attended Marr College.[7][8] He went to Edinburgh University, where he studied first theology and then Scottish history and literature.[6][9] He worked in television and the media prior to establishing his own media company, Eala Bhan Ltd.
Russell is conversant in Gaelic and gave a speech in the language which was the first occasion the European Council was addressed in Gaelic.[10][11]Journalist Chris Deerin described him as ""a man of culture – and he is likely to tell you so"".[12]
Political career[edit]
Russell was Chief Executive of the SNP in the period prior to the first Scottish election of 1999 and has been an active member of the SNP for over three decades, often working closely with former party leader Alex Salmond.
Originally a member of the Labour club at Edinburgh University, Russell joined the SNP in 1974 during the February election of that year, was active in Edinburgh, in the Western Isles and in the Inverness constituency and stood for the first time for as an SNP candidate in 1984 in Clydesdale in a local government election. He was then the Clydesdale candidate for the Westminster Parliament in June 1987. Later that year he became the elected Vice Convenor of the SNP responsible for Publicity (succeeding Alex Salmond) and in 1990 was Salmond's campaign manager during the SNP leadership campaign.
During that time he worked as executive director of Network Scotland, a media and educational company, but he gave up his party posts in 1991 to concentrate on establishing his own TV production company, Eala Bhan Ltd. He returned to active politics in December 1994 when he became the SNP's first full-time Chief Executive. In that role, he was the party's election director for the 1997 and 1999 campaigns as well as for the successful Perth and Kinross by-election in 1995 (having been deputy campaign director in the 1992 General Election and for the Govan and Glasgow Central by-elections of 1987 and 1988).
In November 2020, Russell was elected President of the SNP.[13]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
Russell attending a Scottish Cabinet meeting in Stranraer as Cabinet Secretary for Education & Lifelong Learning in August 2011He was placed second by the party on the South of Scotland list for the 1999 Scottish Parliament elections (as well as standing for the Cunninghame South Constituency which he also fought in 2003) and after his election was appointed SNP Business Manager in the new Parliament which resulted in him becoming a founding member of the Parliamentary Bureau. After John Swinney was elected leader of the SNP in 2000, Russell became Shadow Minister for Education and Culture, a post he held until 2003. He was named as ""Debater of the Year"" in the Herald Awards in 2000, and was nominated for ""Scottish Politician of the Year"" in the same awards in 2002 as well as for the Channel 4 ""Scottish Politician of the Year"" title.
When he lost his seat at the end of the first Scottish Parliament, Russell focused on his work as an author and newspaper columnist, commenting on various aspects of Scottish culture and Scottish politics. He did, however, stand for the leadership of the SNP in 2004, in the election prompted by John Swinney's resignation.[14] He finished third behind Alex Salmond and Roseanna Cunningham. Russell continued as a political commentator, generating some controversy with his strongly free market views in his book, Grasping The Thistle, in which he called for the NHS to be abolished and replaced with an insurance based healthcare system.[15] It also called for inheritance tax and the Barnett Formula to be scrapped and a voucher system introduced for education.[15]Many SNP members saw Russell's absence from the Scottish Parliament as a great loss to the SNP's profile and performance there.[who?] In 2006 he was once again placed second on the SNP regional list in the South of Scotland though this time the list was chosen by a one member, one vote system for which Russell had argued over a long period and was re-elected to Parliament in 2007. He was also the party's candidate in the Dumfries constituency.
Following the SNP's narrow victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, Russell was appointed the Minister for Environment.
In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government in February 2009, Russell was moved to be Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution.[16]In December 2009 Russell was promoted to the Scottish Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning following the repositioning of Fiona Hyslop to Culture, Tourism and External Affairs.[17]Russell left the Scottish Cabinet in November 2014, when Nicola Sturgeon took over as First Minister.[18] On 25 August 2016 he was appointed as the Scottish government's new minister with responsibility for Brexit negotiations with the UK government.[19]During the pandemic he called for Britain to join the EU's vaccine procurement scheme, tweeting about the British Government's decision to go it alone: ""This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic. It will cost lives."".[20][21]He announced in 2020 that he would not be standing for re-election in 2021.[6]In November 2020 he was elected to the honorary position of SNP President – having campaigned on a platform of holding an independence referendum in autumn 2021.[22] Russell won 60% of the vote, beating political blogger Craig Murray,[23] who placed second, and former MP Corri Wilson, who placed third.[22]In response to Operation Branchform and the arrest of Peter Murrell, Russell claimed that the Scottish National Party was facing its biggest crisis in 50 years.[24]
Campaigner[edit]
For many years, Russell has campaigned for justice on behalf of former police detective, Shirley McKie, who was awarded £750,000 compensation by the Scottish Executive in a February 2006 out-of-court settlementISBN 9781841585758). Shirley McKie's case assumed an international significance with a possible linkage to the case of convicted Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was granted leave to appeal against his conviction for a second time by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission on 28 June 2007.[26] Megrahi's appeal began in Edinburgh on 28 April 2009,[27] and a public inquiry into the McKie case started in Glasgow on 2 June 2009.[28]Russell supported the successful campaign to have The Tinkers' Heart in Argyll listed as a Scheduled Monument, with listing taking place in 2015.[29]
Academic career[edit]
In May 2015, the University of Glasgow announced that Russell would be taking up a part-time post as a professor of culture and governance.[30]
Controversies[edit]
Russell attracted criticism regarding the negative depictions of Scottish towns and cities included in his 1998 travel book In Waiting: Travels in the Shadow of Edwin Muir. In his book, Russell said of Glasgow: ""Pull over and stop the car (if you dare) and walk into the closes smelling of urine and rubbish, cluttered with dirt and debris. It is not uncommon to have to step over a comatose body, with or without a needle by its side."" The Scottish capital was also described in a less than positive light: ""The flag on Edinburgh Castle is an awful mutant tablecloth and the National Trust for Scotland is arrogant and elitist.""[31][32][33][34]In November 2009, Russell was engaged in a controversy when his most senior aide was forced to resign after being exposed by the News of the World as the author of an online political blog with controversial content.[35][36]In January 2011 Russell was referred to the parliamentary standards watchdog over allegations that he tried to influence school closures for his own electoral benefit. ""The MSP was reported to Holyrood's standards watchdog after a leaked email revealed he quizzed SNP councillors about their support for the axing of local schools. The message, sent from Mr Russell's parliamentary account, concerned proposed closures in the area where he is due to seek election in May. He now represents the South of Scotland but will stand as a candidate in Argyll & Bute.""[37][38][39][40] Kilmodan Primary, the school nearest to Russell's home was later amongst those saved from closure as well as Toward Primary where his wife Cathleen was headteacher (Cathleen had also been headteacher at Kilmodan).[9][41][42] In January 2011 Mrs Russell transferred to Sandbank Primary School, which was safe from closure.[43]Russell was also accused of interfering in school closure decisions taken by councils.[44] ""The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), the body which represents council leaders, has now written to Mr Russell accusing him of failing to act in a ""consistent, pragmatic and limited way"".""[45]
Russell was further accused of ""bullying"" in his dealings with Shetland Islands Council where the council was asked to postpone cost-cutting school closures. ""Mr Russell was last night accused of ""bullying"" councils into agreeing to his moratorium. A senior local government source said: 'Russell is acting like a school bully on this and bullying councils into backing this delay.'""[46]

Personal detailsBornMichelle Lorraine Cross (1962-11-28) 28 November 1962 (age 61)Ashton-under-Lyne, EnglandPolitical partyReform UK (2021–2022)Other politicalaffiliationsIndependent (2020–2021)Conservative (until 2020)Alma materRoyal London HospitalHeriot-Watt UniversityMichelle Lorraine Ballantyne (née Cross; born 28 November 1962) is a British politician and former nurse who served as Leader of Reform UK Scotland from January 2021 to February 2022.[1][2] She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South Scotland region from 2017 to 2021, having been elected for the Scottish Conservatives.
Born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Ballantyne studied at Royal London Hospital before working as a staff nurse and health service manager in London. She moved to the Scottish Borders in 1990 and established a manufacturing business there with her husband. After graduating with an honours degree from Heriot-Watt University, she managed an acute medicine department in Edinburgh and took a position at a charity supporting people struggling with drugs and alcohol.
Elected to Scottish Borders Council in 2012, Ballantyne took a seat in the Scottish Parliament in 2017 on the Scottish Conservative regional list. She was a candidate in the February 2020 leadership election but lost to Jackson Carlaw. She resigned from the party in November 2020 in protest at its support for coronavirus lockdown measures. After sitting as an independent, she joined Reform UK in January 2021 and was appointed as Leader of Reform UK Scotland. She lost her seat in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and quit as the leader of Reform UK in Scotland in February 2022.

Early life and career[edit]
Ballantyne was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. She studied nursing at Royal London Hospital in East London, beginning her career working as a staff nurse in an intensive care unit before progressing into a finance and management position at South West Thames Regional Health Authority.[3]Ballantyne moved to the Scottish Borders in 1990 to establish a manufacturing business with her husband in Walkerburn. During this period, she continued to work as a nurse within social care, while also completing an Honours degree as a mature student at Heriot-Watt University in Galashiels. After graduation, she returned to health service management in 2000, managing an acute medicine department in Edinburgh.[3]Ballantyne and her husband sold their house and became tenants to enable her to work closer to home. Ballantyne took a position in 2005 as head of an independent local charity providing specialist drug and alcohol support to children, families and offenders.[3]
Political career[edit]
Local government: 2012–2017[edit]
While a member of the Scottish Conservatives, Ballantyne was first elected to Scottish Borders Council at the 2012 council election as one of three representatives for Selkirkshire.[4] She contested the Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale constituency at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election but finished second place behind Christine Grahame.[5]Ballantyne led the Conservative group into the 2017 Scottish Borders Council election. The Conservatives gained five seats at the election and subsequently entered into a coalition with the independent group to take control of the council from the incumbent SNP, Liberal Democrat and independent administration.[6]
Scottish Conservatives: 2017–2020[edit]
In May 2017, Ballantyne was invited to join the Scottish Parliament on the Scottish Conservative regional list and was sworn in as an MSP on 23 May.[7] She replaced Rachael Hamilton, who had resigned her seat to contest the 2017 Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire by-election held on 8 June.[8] Shortly after she joined the Scottish Parliament, Ballantyne was appointed by Ruth Davidson to the Scottish Conservative frontbench in the role of Shadow Minister for Childcare and Early Years.[9]On 3 May 2018, Ballantyne was promoted to Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security.[4] She defended the UK government's two child cap on tax credits in October of that year, claiming it had been fairer to working people having to make decisions about the number of children to have.[10] Her comments sparked heated debate and she accused the SNP of politicising the cap.[11][12] During her tenure as Shadow Social Security Secretary, she also said there was ""no such thing as a bedroom tax"", disagreeing that restricting benefits was equivalent to a tax,[13] and claimed there was no hard evidence as to why the use of foodbanks had increased.[12]Criticising the SNP's record on healthcare within a speech in the Scottish Parliament, Ballantyne said she would be ""quite happy"" if the Scottish Government had no role in running the National Health Service in Scotland.[14]Ballantyne campaigned to change the law to allow assisted dying for consenting terminally ill people in her role as chair of the end of life choices working group, progressing on previous campaign work by Margo MacDonald.[15]Ballantyne was a candidate in the first Scottish Conservative Party leadership election of 2020.[16] During the campaign, her stance on the two child cap was brought up but she defended her views.[17] She eventually lost the leadership election to Jackson Carlaw.[18] She was dropped from Carlaw's Shadow Cabinet in a reshuffle shortly after the election.[19] On 18 February, Carlaw told ITV's Representing Borders that Ballantyne would be moved to a new key position.[20] On 3 March, she assumed office as convener of the Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee.[21]
Reform UK: 2020–2022[edit]
On 24 November 2020, Ballantyne announced she would leave the Scottish Conservatives to sit as an independent MSP, citing differences on policies and principles with the party and its new leader Douglas Ross, especially with regards to the party's support for coronavirus lockdown measures; she said that she and the party were no longer ""a good fit"".[22] Her resignation and subsequent criticisms of lockdowns in Scotland won her support from former MSP and MEP Brian Monteith.[23]Ballantyne joined Reform UK in January 2021 and was appointed as Leader of Reform UK Scotland. She said the party would advocate low taxes, entrepreneurship and policies reflecting personal choice and local communities. Chairman Richard Tice added the party would stand at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election on a platform of devolving powers to local government.[24] In February, she reiterated her criticisms of lockdowns and wrote a column for The Scotsman arguing the damage to the mental health of children and young people had been disproportionate to the benefits of controlling coronavirus.[25]Ballantyne lost her seat in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. She received 779 votes (0.2%) of the vote and was not returned to Holyrood.[26]In February 2022 she quit her position as the leader of Reform UK in Scotland and announced she was quitting her role in politics to focus on a multimillion-pound restoration of The Haining country house.[1][2]
Personal life[edit]
The eldest of four siblings, Ballantyne has been married to her husband Neil since December 1983 and together they have six children. Neil is a former officer in the King's Own Scottish Borderers.[3] She is managing trustee of The Haining,[27] a patron of a foodbank in Penicuik[28] and a council member of Friends at the End.[29]Starting in 2000, Ballantyne was an adult volunteer in the Air Training Corps and she received a commission as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch).[30]  Two years later, she was promoted to flying officer.[31] Ballantyne resigned her commission in June 2003.[32]
Notes[edit]

^ Normally, regional MSPs do not have individual predecessors and successors. However, Hamilton retired her seat during a sitting parliament so was succeeded by Ballantyne.

The firm self-funded research involving 236 senior Scottish business leaders across industry to establish their concerns over Brexit. The final report was published in February 2018. Its principal findings and recommendations included the need for a new skills strategy[11] and greater financial and practical support from government.[12]In November 2018, Thomson was a co-author of a Momentous Change Ltd report into the prospects for establishing a Scottish Stock Exchange.[13] In 2020 she was co-author of a report into the Scottish Business Diaspora.[14]
Political career[edit]
Edinburgh West MP (2015–2017)[edit]
Thomson joined the Scottish National Party at the age of sixteen in 1981.[10] She became prominent politically during the Scottish independence referendum campaign, with the ""Yes"" campaign. She was elected as the Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West in 2015 with a majority of 3,210 votes and a 39% share of the vote; with a swing of 25.8% from Liberal Democrat to SNP. The Sunday Post described her as one of the SNP MPs to watch in the new parliament.[15][16]The National described Thomson as ""a breath of fresh air"" in light of her broad-based life experience.[17]As part of her role on the BEIS committee, Thomson was one of the members of the joint committee inquiries into the collapse of BHS,[18] into the working practices of Sports Direct.[19][20]In September 2015, Thomson was accused by an article in The Sunday Times of having built her buy-to-let property portfolio by buying homes for below-market prices.[21] In late-September 2015, Police Scotland announced it had launched an inquiry into ""alleged irregularities"" related to the property transactions which had seen her solicitor struck off.[22] The same day the SNP issued a statement on behalf of Thomson, announcing that she had decided to withdraw herself from the party whip whilst the investigation was ongoing. In resigning the whip, Thomson also lost her SNP membership and her role as the SNP's Business, Innovation and Skills spokesperson at Westminster.[4] Thomson subsequently claimed she had been forced to resign the whip.[23][24][25] Eight months after the story broke, Thomson issued a press statement noting that there had been no contact with her from Police Scotland.[26]In December 2016, in a House of Commons debate focused on UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, Thomson described the impact of having been raped at the age of fourteen years old, highlighting the conditions of silence and shame that prevent rape from being discussed or reported.[27]Thomson was sitting as an independent MP when the 2017 snap general election was called on 18 April 2017. The SNP's national executive met four days later and ruled that they would not endorse her as an SNP candidate. She did not stand as an independent at that election, issuing a statement that noted, ""even in political parties the concept of natural justice must apply, as must the need for defined processes that are applied fairly, rigorously and transparently. I would advise the SNP to employ the services of an external body to help them develop a process as soon as possible.""[28]In August 2017, the police investigation was dropped.[29] Former Scottish Government Minister Kenny MacAskill said the SNP had lessons to learn over their handling of her case.[30] Former First Minister Alex Salmond was also quoted as saying how badly Thomson had been treated by the media and the SNP.[31]
Falkirk East MSP (2021–present)[edit]
Thomson re-joined the SNP in October 2018.[32] She was then selected as the SNP parliamentary candidate for the Falkirk East constituency in the Scottish parliamentary elections of May 2021,[33] and she was elected to Holyrood with 47.4% of the vote.[34] She endorsed Kate Forbes in the 2023 Scottish National Party leadership election,[35] taking over running her campaign after Ivan McKee stepped back.[36]

Personal detailsBorn (1945-12-25) 25 December 1945 (age 78)Northern RhodesiaPolitical partyScottish Liberal DemocratsWebsite[1]Mike Pringle (born 25 December 1945) is a Scottish Liberal Democrat politician.  He was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Edinburgh South from 2003 to 2011.

Background[edit]
He was born in Northern Rhodesia (modern-day Zambia), and educated at Edinburgh Academy. He is a keen follower of Heart of Midlothian F.C. and was a strong supporter of the campaign to prevent the sale of the club's Tynecastle stadium in 2004. He is a strong supporter of the Free Tibet Campaign and has introduced a Bill into the Scottish Parliament to introduce a levy on plastic bags in Scotland similar to the successful Irish plastic bag tax. He has been an Honorary Vice-president of English-Speaking Union Scotland.

Political career[edit]

He served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for North East Scotland,[2] from 2016 to 2021. He previously represented West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine before being defeated at the 2011 election in the successor constituency of Aberdeenshire West).[3][4][5]
Background[edit]
Rumbles was born in South Shields in England and was educated at St James School in Hebburn, County Durham, Sunderland Polytechnic where he graduated with a BEd, and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He served in the Royal Army Education Corps retiring as a Major in October 1994.[6]Rumbles obtained an MSc in economics at Aberystwyth University and he studied at the University of Leicester where he completed a PGD in Employment Law.[7]
Career[edit]
Rumbles was elected to the West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine constituency in the 1999 election, and comfortably held the seat in the 2003 election and 2007 election but was defeated by the SNP in 2011. Following the Scottish Parliament's establishment in 1999, Rumbles was Convenor of the Standards Committee when it was charged with investigating the so-called 'Lobbygate' scandal, in which the son of the then Secretary of State for Scotland John Reid was embroiled.  He promoted the legislation to establish an independent Standards Commissioner, the first Committee Bill of the Parliament.[8]
Leadership contests[edit]
On 12 May 2005, Rumbles announced his intention to stand for the vacant post of leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. His candidacy involved a distinct platform from his opponent Nicol Stephen. In particular, he specified a number of 'deal-breakers' for any coalition negotiations that might occur in the aftermath of the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections, with an absolute insistence on the implementation of key Liberal Democrat policies such as abolition of the council tax, and an enhancement of the Scottish Parliament's powers.  He also aimed to give the Liberal Democrats a more equal status within the coalition. He lost to Stephen in June 2005, winning 23.4% of the vote.
On 2 July 2008, following Stephen's surprise resignation as leader, Rumbles again announced his intention to stand for the Scottish Liberal Democrat leadership. This time he stressed his commitment to reviewing party policy on whether to hold a national referendum on Scottish independence (the policy of the Scottish National Party government). In the contest he faced former Ministers Ross Finnie and Tavish Scott. Scott won the contest comfortably.

Personal life[edit]
Rumbles married Pauline Sillars in 1985. They have two sons.[1]

Watson was elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Central at a by-election in 1989, following the death of Bob McTaggart MP. He was re-elected in the 1992 election and represented that constituency until it was abolished in 1997. He sought the nomination from the Labour party to run for the Govan seat at the 1997 election, but after initially winning the nomination by one vote, he lost a re-run to Mohammad Sarwar.
On 6 November 1997, he was created a life peer as Baron Watson of Invergowrie, of Invergowrie in Perth and Kinross.[5][6]In 1999 Lord Watson was elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow Cathcart constituency and was re-elected in 2003. On 20 July 1999 Watson announced his intention to introduce the Protection of Wild Mammals bill as a member's bill to the Scottish Parliament to outlaw fox hunting. The bill passed a vote 83–36 on 13 February 2002[7] and received Royal Assent on 15 March, becoming the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and becoming law on 1 August. This was a precursor to the Hunting Act 2004 banning fox hunting in England and Wales.[citation needed]When Jack McConnell became First Minister in 2001, Watson entered the Scottish Executive as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. He left the Executive in 2003, having lost his position in a reshuffle after the 2003 election.[8] He subsequently became deputy convener of the enterprise and culture committee.[8]On 15 November 2004, Watson was charged with wilful fire raising, and the Labour whip was withdrawn from him in the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments.[8] On 1 September 2005 he admitted the offence and resigned from the Scottish Parliament.[9] Watson was also expelled from the Labour Party when the sentence was announced.[10] After serving a prison sentence he was released in May 2006.
In January 2007 Watson was appointed as an Associate Director with Caledonia Consulting, while also attending the House of Lords on a regular basis.[citation needed] Watson was re-admitted to membership of the Labour Party in July 2012, after a vote of the National Executive Committee.[1] In September 2015, Jeremy Corbyn appointed Watson as the Labour spokesman on education in the Lords.[3]
Fire-raising conviction[edit]
On 15 November 2004, Lord Watson was charged with two counts of ""wilful fire raising"" after a private reception at Edinburgh's Prestonfield Hotel following the Scottish Politician of the Year awards on 11 November.[11] The first alleged that he set fire to a curtain in the hotel's reception, and the second that he set fire to a curtain in the hotel's Yellow Room. On being charged, the Labour whip was suspended in the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments.[8]After initially registering not guilty pleas to both charges on 23 August 2005,[8] he changed his plea on 1 September to guilty on the first count, and had a not guilty plea accepted on the second charge.[9]On the same day that Lord Watson admitted his guilt, he resigned from the Scottish Parliament. He resigned as a director of Dundee United Football Club.[9] It was not possible for a life peer to resign from the House of Lords at that time and there was no provision for peers convicted of criminal offences to be stripped of their titles. Such legislation was last proposed following the conviction of Jeffrey Archer for perjury in 2001, but rejected.[citation needed]  The House of Lords Reform Act 2014 made resignation possible.
On 22 September 2005, Lord Watson was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment.[10] Sheriff Kathrine Mackie justified the sentence, stating that there was both ""a significant risk of re-offending"" and that Lord Watson offered no explanation. She also told Lord Watson that consumption of alcohol ""neither excuses nor fully explains your behaviour"". The sentence was reduced from 20 months to 16 because Watson had pleaded guilty before the case reached trial.[10] Watson appealed against his sentence on 23 March 2006 but the appeal judges refused to cut the term, and he was returned to prison. After serving half of his sentence (eight months), he was released on 23 May 2006.[12]
Views on Jeremy Corbyn[edit]
In an interview with The House magazine in March 2017, Lord Watson was asked whether Labour could win a UK general election under Jeremy Corbyn. He said: ""Probably not. There are trends there that suggest we're not getting through and the result in Copeland certainly suggested that, so it will be difficult to turn that around. But we shouldn't underestimate the extent to which the government can get into difficulties over the European Union exit negotiations. It's not going to be anything approaching plain sailing for them.""[13]

Personal detailsBornMiles Edward Frank Briggs (1983-03-30) 30 March 1983 (age 40)Preston, Lancashire, EnglandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesAlma materRobert Gordon UniversityWebsitewww.milesbriggs.scotMiles Edward Frank Briggs (born 30 March 1983) is a British politician of the Scottish Conservative Party, who has served as a regional list Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothian region since the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[1] He served as the Scottish Conservative Shadow Cabinet member for Health and Sport from 2017 to 2020 and as the Scottish Conservative Chief Whip from 2020 to 2021.

Early life[edit]
Briggs was born in Preston, Lancashire in England, before moving to Perthshire with his family when he was young. Briggs was educated at Auchtergaven Primary School, Perth Grammar School and Robert Gordon University.

Political career[edit]
Briggs was the official Conservative Party candidate at the 2010 general election for the North East Fife constituency, then in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election for North East Fife. In 2016, he stood for the Edinburgh Southern constituency.
In December 2015, Briggs was named second on the Scottish Conservatives' Lothian regional list in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, behind party leader Ruth Davidson.[2]Briggs is the Scottish Conservative spokesman for Mental Health and Public Health in the Scottish Parliament[3] In addition, he sits on the Health and Sport Committee of the Scottish Parliament.[4]Briggs was announced as the official Conservative Party candidate for Edinburgh South West at the 2017 general election. He finished in second place, and received 16,478 votes, behind the sitting SNP MP, Joanna Cherry. Despite not being elected, Briggs was successful in significantly reducing Cherry's majority from 8,135 votes at the previous election, to just 1,097 votes.
On 12 January 2022, Briggs called for Boris Johnson to resign as Conservative party leader and Prime Minister over the Westminster lockdown parties controversy along with a majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs.[5]
Controversy[edit]
In 2018, Briggs was accused by a woman from another political party of sexual harassment at a parliamentary event. After an internal investigation, the Scottish Conservatives found Briggs not guilty of making ""unwanted persistent advances"" towards the woman. Women's rights charity Rape Crisis Scotland voiced ""significant concerns"" with how the investigation was conducted and called on the Scottish Conservatives to change the way they investigate claims of sexual harassment. The charity claimed that the party would not reveal whether the investigating committee had received training in how to investigate sexual harassment complaints.[6]

Personal detailsBornMonica Ward (1981-01-07) 7 January 1981 (age 43)Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourSpouseJim LennonChildren1Alma materUniversity of StrathclydeMonica Lennon (née Ward; born 7 January 1981) is a Scottish politician who has served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Central Scotland region since 2016. A member of the Scottish Labour Party, she has served in various roles on the Scottish Labour front bench. She was the Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Health and Sport from 2018 to 2021, Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work from March 2021 to June 2021 and Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Net Zero, Energy and Transport from June 2021 to November 2021. She was a candidate in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election and currently serves on the Scottish Parliament's Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee. 

Early life and career[edit]
Lennon was born in Bellshill and raised in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, the daughter of Gerard Ward, a council health and safety manager, and his wife Helen. She attended the co-educational Roman Catholic John Ogilvie High School in Hamilton.[1] She studied environmental planning at the University of Strathclyde, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2001. While studying she lived with her father. Her parents had separated, and later divorced, as a result of her father's drinking which developed into severe alcoholism.[2]From 2001 to 2007, Lennon worked as a planning officer for South Lanarkshire Council. She married at the age of 24 but felt forced to exclude her father from the wedding because of his alcoholism; he died at the age of 60.[3]After leaving South Lanarkshire Council, she worked as a surveyor for commercial property consultancy Knight Frank, also freelancing as a planning consultant, until her election in 2012.[1]
Political career[edit]
In the 2012 South Lanarkshire Council election, Lennon was elected to represent the Hamilton North and East ward. In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, she was second on Scottish Labour's Central Scotland regional list and was elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament.[4] Shortly after being elected she was appointed by leader Kezia Dugdale as Shadow Minister for Inequalities, a role in which she campaigned to raise awareness about the need for women to check themselves for signs of breast cancer.[5]In the 2017 Scottish Labour leadership election, Lennon nominated fellow Central Scotland MSP and left-wing ally Richard Leonard.[6] In December 2017, Leonard announced his new frontbench in which she was promoted to Spokesperson for Communities and Local Government.[7]
Lennon in 2016In November 2017, Lennon went public with how she was sexually assaulted by a Labour colleague at a party in 2013, while other colleagues brushed off the incident. Following revelations of similar incidents within the party, she argued that the party and British politics had an institutional problem with sexual assault and harassment.[8]On 6 September 2018, Lennon made a speech in which she spoke of a constituent who had committed suicide shortly after Christmas 2017. The constituent pleaded with health services for help eight times in the six days directly before he died, but was either turned away or referred elsewhere. Lennon asked Nicola Sturgeon to take urgent action to review suicide prevention procedures in NHS Lanarkshire.[9]In an October 2018 Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, Lennon was again promoted to Spokesperson for Health and Sport, replacing Richard Leonard's former leadership rival Anas Sarwar.[10] She used the position to campaign for institutions to provide free menstrual hygiene products, to tackle period poverty.[11]The Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Act was enacted in November 2020.[12][13]Along with Neil Findlay, Lennon abstained on an SNP government bill in favour of a second Scottish independence referendum. This was against their party's whip, which was to vote against the bill.[14]Following the resignation of Richard Leonard, Lennon joined the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[15] During the campaign, Lennon said she would not oppose a second Scottish independence referendum although would argue for an alternative Devo Max option.[16] She commented that the war on drugs had failed and drug laws should be devolved to Scotland and drugs decriminalised. She also said people across the UK ""deserve a public health approach that meets their needs"".[17] She pledged to end the care home ""dementia tax"" and said Scottish Labour with her as leader would commit to reviewing social care policies to ensure people with advanced dementia receive equal treatment. She has backed Alzheimer Scotland's Fair Dementia Care campaign.[18][19] She was defeated by her rival Anas Sarwar.[20][21][22]In 2020, Lennon was selected as the Scottish Labour candidate in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[23][24] She was defeated by incumbent Christina McKelvie of the SNP, but was re-elected via the Central region list.[25]In the wake of anti-abortion protests in Glasgow in the spring of 2022, Lennon called for an emergency summit in Holyrood.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Lennon is married to Jim Lennon and has one daughter, Isabella.[2] She is a feminist and a vegetarian, and suffers from ailurophobia, an irrational fear of cats.[1]

Personal detailsBornMurdo MacKenzie Fraser (1965-09-05) 5 September 1965 (age 58)Inverness, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesAlma materUniversity of AberdeenOccupationSolicitorWebsiteOfficial WebsiteMurdo MacKenzie Fraser (born 5 September 1965) is a Scottish politician who served as Deputy Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party from 2005 to 2011. He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Mid Scotland and Fife region since 2001. Since May 2021, he has served  as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery, shadowing Deputy First Minister John Swinney.[1]
Early life[edit]
Born in 1965, Fraser was educated at Inverness Royal Academy. He studied law at the University of Aberdeen, and was chairman of the Scottish Young Conservatives from 1989 to 1992. During this time, he said he had ""appropriated"" a plaque marking a TV lounge that had been named to honour Nelson Mandela, as a prank to annoy left-wing students. In 2016, Fraser said he returned the engraved ""trophy"" to students, although Aberdeen University Student Association disputes the claim.[2]After undertaking a postgraduate Diploma in Legal Studies, he worked as a solicitor in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, latterly as an associate with Ketchen and Stevens WS in Edinburgh, specialising in commercial law.

Political career[edit]
At the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, Fraser was an unsuccessful candidate for North Tayside, as he was in 2003 and 2007. He stood unsuccessfully for the House of Commons at the 1997 general election in East Lothian and at the 2001 general election in North Tayside.
Fraser became an MSP in 2001, after the resignation of Nick Johnston, as next name on the Conservative Party's Mid Scotland and Fife list. He gained a list seat in 2003, 2007, 2011, 2016 and 2021, having lost to John Swinney on each occasion in the constituency vote. Previously the convenor of the Economy, Energy, and Tourism Committee, Fraser is a member of the Finance Committee of the Scottish Parliament.[3]He became deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives in November 2005 when Annabel Goldie became leader. After the 2011 election, at which 15 Conservative MSPs were elected, Annabel Goldie triggered a leadership election by announcing that she would stand down in Autumn 2011.
In June 2014, Fraser spoke in favour of reconstituting the United Kingdom on a federal basis.[4]
Party leadership election[edit]
After being elected through the party list in 2011, he announced in August his decision to seek the leadership of the Scottish Conservative Party,[5] and launched his campaign on 4 September in Edinburgh. His launch plans included a commitment to further devolution to the Scottish Parliament from Westminster, as well as launching a new party to redefine the politics of Scotland, harnessing the support of the centre-right, but independent of the UK Conservative Party and with a new name and identity.[6] Fraser was unsuccessful in his attempt to be elected party leader, losing out to Ruth Davidson,[7] and following the election was succeeded as deputy leader by Jackson Carlaw.[8]

Personal detailsBornNeil Murray Tosh (1950-09-01) 1 September 1950 (age 73)Ayr, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish ConservativesNeil Murray Tosh (born 1 September 1950)[1] is a retired Scottish Conservative Party politician who served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South of Scotland region (1999–2003) and the West of Scotland region (2003–07).

Early life and career[edit]
Born in Ayr, Tosh was educated at Kilmarnock Academy and the University of Glasgow, where he graduated with a second-class honours degree.[1] He trained as a schoolteacher at Jordanhill College in Glasgow, and for nearly 25 years taught history at several schools in Ayrshire. Before being elected to the Scottish Parliament he was head of the history department at Belmont Academy in Ayr.[1]
Political career[edit]
Tosh contested Ayr at the October 1974 general election as a Liberal, and Glasgow Hillhead at the 1983 general election for the Conservatives.[2] From 1987 to 1996, he represented Troon South-West ward on Kyle and Carrick District Council, where he rose to become deputy leader of the Conservative group.[3][4]At the inaugural election for the Scottish Parliament in 1999, Tosh stood as the Conservative candidate for Cunninghame South, where he came third; instead, he was elected to Holyrood as one of four candidates on the party's South of Scotland regional list. Regarded as being on the Conservative left, he was convener of the Procedures Committee during his first term in parliament. In 2001 he announced his intention to stand down at the next election so that he could return to local government, amidst speculation that he was unhappy about the selection of right-winger Iain Duncan Smith as national party leader.[5]However, he unexpectedly won the race to become a Deputy Presiding Officer that same year, defeating Cathy Peattie by 68 votes to 45, which led him to reverse his earlier decision to leave Holyrood.[4][6] Press reports attributed his victory to the heavy-handed attempts by the Labour Party leader, Jack McConnell, to force his MSPs to support Peattie en masse, which prompted a backlash from several of them and public allegations of 'cronyism'.[4][7]Tosh remained a Deputy Presiding Officer for the next six years, until the end of the second parliament in 2007. In that year's elections, he was the Conservative candidate for Dumfries, where he was defeated by Elaine Murray, the Labour incumbent. Having been placed a lowly fourth in the party's South of Scotland regional list, he therefore did not return to Holyrood as an MSP for the 2007–2011 session.[citation needed]
Later years[edit]
In 2011, Tosh was one of those who backed Ruth Davidson's bid to become leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, describing her as a ""breath of fresh air in Scottish politics"".[8]In 2016, the representatives of the IndyCamp protesters stated that Tosh may own the Scottish Parliament building. This claim was dismissed by the lawyer for the Scottish Parliament.[9]

A member of Scottish Labour, he was previously a councillor in West Lothian from 2003 to 2012.

Early life and career[edit]
Findlay was born in 1969 in Bangour General Hospital, near Broxburn. He was raised in Blackburn, West Lothian and educated at the co-educational, Roman Catholic St Kentigern's Academy.[1]After leaving school in 1986, he became an apprentice bricklayer in his father's business, and spent ten years working there. During this time, he also studied at the University of Strathclyde, gaining a Bachelor of Arts in Geography and Politics, and going on to become a housing officer in 1996. After working for Almond Housing Association in Livingston for seven years, Findlay completed a PGCE at the University of Glasgow in 2003 and became a teacher in Falkirk for the next eight years.[2][3]Findlay describes himself as a socialist and trade unionist, and is on the left of the Labour Party, he's also has a committed Anti-Trident stance and is a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and has been heavily critical in the past of his own party's position on Nuclear Weapons.

Political career[edit]
In 2003, Findlay was elected onto West Lothian Council as a Scottish Labour councillor for the Fauldhouse and Breich Valley ward. He was re-elected in 2007 and stood down in 2012.[2]In 2011, Findlay was elected to the Scottish Parliament as one of seven additional members for Lothian list.[4]In 2012, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Skills and Learning.[3] Leader Johann Lamont appointed him to the frontbench as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing on 29 May 2013.[5] He has also been a member of the Scottish Parliament's Performance Committee, Local Area Committee and the Services for the Community Policy Development and Scrutiny Panel.[citation needed]Ahead of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum in 2014, Findlay campaigned for a No vote, advocating a ""devomax"" position, however unlike many of his colleagues within the Scottish Labour, he did not join the official Better Together movement and was a strong critic of his party's involvement due to it being a collaboration with the Conservatives. Instead, Findlay was part of the Red Paper Collective along with other members of the Scottish Labour Left and the Communist Party of Britain, which aimed to promote a left-wing, socialist vision for voting No on 18 September 2014. 
On 29 October 2014, Findlay declared he would stand in the upcoming Scottish Labour leadership election.[6] Initially, he wanted Gordon Brown to stand but Brown ruled himself out. Calling for a ""clear red water"" between Labour and the Scottish National Party, Findlay proposed raising the minimum wage, reintroducing council house building, reducing private sector use in the NHS and allowing councils to set taxes to help reverse job losses within their areas.[7] The trade unions ASLEF, CWU, GMB, Musicians' Union, NUM, RMT, TSSA, UCATT, UNISON and Unite supported his candidature.[8][9][10][11][12] He came second to Jim Murphy with 34.99% of the vote.[13] In the aftermath of his leadership bid, Findlay was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Fair Work, Skills and Training on 16 December 2014 by Murphy and remained in the post until being reshuffled out by Murphy's successor, Kezia Dugdale in August 2015.[14][15]Findlay was the Scottish campaign chief for Jeremy Corbyn during the 2015 Labour leadership election, and is the convener of Scottish Labour's Campaign for Socialism, succeeding Elaine Smith.[16][17] From 2016 until 2017, he served as convener of the Scottish Parliament's Health and Sport Committee.[18] In 2017, he published his book Socialism and Hope: A journey through turbulent times, co-authored with biographer and journalist Jeff Holmes.[1]Findlay was appointed Scottish Labour's Brexit spokesperson by new leader Richard Leonard on 19 November 2017, and then also as Parliamentary Business Manager on 4 October 2018.[19][20] In early May 2019, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray accused him of ""bullying and harassment"" in a complaint to Scottish Labour's General Secretary Brian Roy. In turn, Findlay issued a counter-complaint over ""derogatory"" WhatsApp messages in which Murray accused the leadership of being ""full of thugs and incompetents"".[21]On 28 May 2019, the day after it was confirmed Scottish Labour had finished fifth in Scotland in the European election and lost both its MEPs, Findlay resigned as Brexit spokesperson and Business Manager. He also intimated he would leave the Scottish Parliament after the 2021 election. He indicated he had made this decision in March after months of thought and denied he was resigning due to the election result. He was however critical of ""eternal internal fighting within our party and the toxic culture of leaks and briefings that come from some within the Scottish and UK parliamentary groups"".[22][23] Following his resignation, he argued Scottish Labour needed to adopt a ""clear and easily understood position on the constitution"", having previously argued in favour of a federal United Kingdom.[22]On 6 September 2019, a consultation launched by Findlay in the January reported there was overwhelming public support for his proposals for a bill to ban MSPs having second jobs, with some exceptions described as ""common sense"".[24][25] In the October, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson announced she was accepting a public relations role for lobbying firm Tulchan Communications while retaining her job as an MSP and Findlay used her appointment as further justification for his bill, arguing the rules which allowed her to do so were ""not fit for purpose"".[26][27]Along with Monica Lennon, Findlay abstained on an SNP government bill in favour of a second Scottish independence referendum. This was against their party's whip, which was to vote against the bill.[28]Findlay mocked Richard Leonard's critics in a September 2020 leaked email: ""I support Richard 100% - the usual suspects think we just need to wind back to 1997 and then wave a union flag with gusto with Ian Murray and [deputy leader] Jackie Baillie leading and all will be well - delusion doesn't come close to it.""[29] He also described Leonard's critics in Labour's Scottish Parliament group in the Morning Star as ""a kamikaze squad ... determined to destroy what remains of the party"".[30]Findlay nominated Monica Lennon in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[31]
Personal life[edit]
Findlay is married to Fiona Miller, with whom he has one daughter, Chloe.[1] He is a member of the trade unions Unite and Educational Institute of Scotland.[32][1]

Personal detailsBornNeil Charles Gray (1986-03-16) 16 March 1986 (age 37)Kirkwall, Orkney, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyChildren4Alma materUniversity of StirlingNeil Charles Gray (born 16 March 1986) is a Scottish politician serving as Cabinet Secretary for Wellbeing Economy, Fair Work and Energy since 2023, having previously served as Minister for Culture, Europe and International Development from 2022 to 2023. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Airdrie & Shotts since 2021, having previously been an Member of Parliament (MP) for the equivalent Westminster seat from 2015 to 2021.

Early life[edit]
Gray was born and brought up in Orkney, and was educated at Kirkwall Grammar School.[1] He graduated from the University of Stirling in 2008 with a first-class Bachelor of Arts Honours degree in politics and journalism.[2]Following his graduation, Gray was employed as a producer and reporter with BBC Radio Orkney from 2003 until 2008.[citation needed]
Political career[edit]
Early years[edit]
Gray worked as a press and research intern for the SNP parliamentary group at the Scottish Parliament.[3] Gray was also employed by Alex Neil MSP from 2008, being appointed as constituency office manager in 2011.[3]The selection process for the Airdrie SNP candidacy, which Neil Gray ultimately won, was not without controversy. Former diplomat Craig Murray was nominated as a potential candidate at an Airdrie Branch meeting but did not make the final list as he failed SNP candidate vetting, whereupon he commented that ""I think in both Airdrie & Shotts and in Falkirk it's evident who the party hierarchy wants to be the candidate.""[4] Former Policeman and SNP Councillor Alan Beveridge resigned from the party in February 2015 after Neil Gray was selected, claiming that there was a ""climate of fear, intimidation and false allegations within the party"" which were highlighted in the selection process.[5][6]
Westminster; 2015–2021[edit]
Gray's Westminster portrait, 2020In September 2016, Gray as a member of the new Joint Committee on the Palace of Westminster proposed ""the Joint Committee declines to consider a draft Report until it has given full consideration to the possibility of constructing a permanent new Parliamentary building, while finding an alternative future use for the Palace of Westminster; notes that this option was included in the Pre-Feasibility Study and Preliminary Strategic Business Case published in October 2012 but was rejected by the House of Commons Commission and the House of Lords House Committee at that stage; and resolves to apply the same rigorous scrutiny to the possible construction of a new Parliamentary building as it has applied to the other options for delivering the Restoration and Renewal Programme, before making a recommendation about the best option for carrying out the works"";[7] the committee voted 11–1 against this proposal.
In 2017, he held Airdrie and Shotts with a significantly reduced majority of 195 votes, although he did increase that in the 2019 general election to a stronger majority of 5,000 votes over the second-placed Labour candidate.[citation needed]Gray has campaigned extensively in support of Roadchef employees, and former employees, who have waited over 20 years for the repayment of money wrongly appropriated by former executive Tim Ingram Hill.[8] On 8 January 2020, he questioned the Prime Minister on the issue, receiving an assurance that the Chancellor would ""discuss"" the matter with him.[9]In November 2020, Gray announced that he would be resigning as an MP in order to try and win a seat in the Scottish Parliament at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[10] On 23 March 2021, he made his final speech in the House of Commons,[11] and was appointed Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead a day later. He is the only SNP member to have held that notional office.[12] North Lanarkshire Council calculated that his decision to resign as an MP and trigger a by-election cost taxpayers £175,000.[13]
Election to Holyrood[edit]
On 7 May 2021, Gray was elected as the MSP for Airdrie and Shotts, finishing ahead of former Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard.[14] Following his election, Gray said, as deputy convener of his the SNP's Social Justice and Fairness Commission, that a couple with two children in an independent Scotland could be guaranteed a minimum income of £37,000 annually by the state. He admitted that he had not costed the proposal.[15]In a ministerial reshuffle on 24 January 2022, Gray was appointed as Minister for Culture, Europe and International Development.[16][17]
Personal life[edit]
Outside politics Gray was formerly a keen athlete, representing Scotland in the 400 m, until a serious knee injury ended his career in athletics.[18]Neil has three daughters and one son with his wife, Karlie.[19][20]

Personal detailsBorn (1948-01-05) 5 January 1948 (age 76)Filey, EnglandPolitical partyScottish Conservative PartySpouseAnna Jiménez-OlivePaul Nicholas Johnston (born 5 January 1948) is a Scottish politician who was a Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Mid Scotland and Fife region from May 1999 until August 2001.[1]
Early life[edit]
Paul Nicholas Johnston was born in Filey, England on 5 January 1948.[2] He attended North Kesteven Grammar School in North Hykeham, Lincolnshire. Johnston then joined the Royal Engineers and attended Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. From 1972 he worked in the car retail industry, becoming Group Operations Director of Eastern Western Motor Group.-->

Political career[edit]
Johnston stood as a Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate for the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and was elected for the Mid Scotland and Fife region.[3] At the beginning of Parliament, Johnston took the oath in Catalan.[4] In January 2001 he wrote a letter to The Times, where he expressed disillusionment with the attitude of other politicians.[5] An absence from Parliament began in February 2001 with an episode of pneumonia. Johnston resigned in August 2001, citing disillusionment with politics and his perception of a weak party leadership as reasons for doing so.[6][7]His place in the Scottish Parliament was taken by Murdo Fraser.[8]Johnston was among a group of former MSPs who supported Scottish independence, saying that it would give Scotland an opportunity to ""create a fairer, more equal society"".[9][10]
Notes[edit]

^ Normally, regional MSPs do not have individual predecessors and successors. However, Johnston resigned during a sitting parliament so was succeeded by Murdo Fraser.

Personal detailsBorn (1960-03-23) 23 March 1960 (age 63)Aberdeen, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Liberal DemocratsSpouseCaris Doig (Lady Stephen)Children4Alma materUniversity of Aberdeen, University of EdinburghNicol Ross Stephen, Baron Stephen (born 23 March 1960) is a Scottish politician who served as Deputy First Minister of Scotland and Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning from 2005 to 2007. A member of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, he was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Aberdeen South from 1999 to 2011, and was leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 2005 to 2008.
Stephen was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999. Following the coalition agreement between the Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Labour, he became Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. Later in the same parliamentary term he became Deputy Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs, and then for Education and Young People. Following the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, he joined the Scottish Executive cabinet as Minister for Transport.
In 2005, following the resignation of his predecessor Jim Wallace, Stephen was elected leader of the party and also became deputy first minister and Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. He led his party into the 2007 election, where it won 16 seats (down one on 2003). He resigned as party leader on 2 July 2008, triggering a leadership election. In 2011 he joined the House of Lords. He became a patron of The Aberdeen Law Project in 2011.

Background and family life[edit]
Born in Aberdeen,[1] he was educated at Robert Gordon's College in Aberdeen and at the University of Aberdeen, where he obtained an LLB in 1980. He then took his Diploma in Legal Practice at the University of Edinburgh School of Law and worked for a number of years as a solicitor before moving into corporate finance as a senior manager with Deloitte & Touche.
He was a former Chair of CREATE (a group campaigning for rail electrification between Aberdeen and Edinburgh); a chairperson of STAR (Save Tor-na-Dee Hospital and Roxburghe House); and the founder and director of Grampian Enterprise.
He is married with 4 children.[2]
Early political career[edit]
He was elected to Grampian Regional Council in 1982 (as Scotland's youngest councillor) and was Chair of Grampian's Economic Development and Planning Committee from 1986 to 1991.
He was briefly a Member of Parliament for the Kincardine and Deeside constituency, elected in the November 1991 by-election following the death of Conservative and Unionist Alick Buchanan-Smith. He was a member of the Liberal Democrat treasury team and spokesperson on small business during his time in the House of Commons. The seat returned to the Conservative and Unionist party at the 1992 general election, when it was won by George Kynoch.
He later stood for the Aberdeen South constituency in the 1997 election for Aberdeen South, but was defeated by the Scottish Labour candidate.[3]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
Minister and Deputy Minister roles[edit]
Nicol Stephen was elected as MSP for Aberdeen South in the first elections to the Scottish Parliament. He later helped negotiate the Partnership Agreement for the coalition government with the Labour Party.[4]He later served in the Scottish Executive as Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning[5] (1999 to 2000), then as Deputy Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs (2000 to 2001),[6] and as Deputy Minister for Education and Young People (2001 to 2003).
Following the 2003 election, he was appointed Minister for Transport. During his time in this post, he was responsible for approving the controversial M74 extension.[7]
Deputy First Minister[edit]
Following the resignation of Jim Wallace in May 2005 as leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Nicol Stephen announced his intention to stand for the leadership.[8] He defeated rival candidate, Mike Rumbles, who advocated ending the coalition agreement with the Scottish Labour Party, winning 76.6%, becoming party leader on 23 June 2005. Four days later on 27 June 2005, he was appointed Deputy First Minister of Scotland.[9] Following his leadership victory, a mini-reshuffle of the Scottish Cabinet, saw him take on the role of Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.[10]
Opposition[edit]
Following the 2007 general election, the SNP emerged as the largest party by one seat but short of an overall majority, they held discussions with the Scottish Green Party and also intimated that it would be open to discussions with the Liberal Democrats. However, since the Liberal Democrats had indicated that they would not enter discussions with parties which continued to favour a referendum on independence, no formal talks were held. The SNP became a minority administration and officially entered government on 17 May 2007; Nicol Stephen ceased to be Deputy First Minister and began led his party to the opposition benches.
Despite being out of government, his party worked with the SNP Government on certain issues where they broadly agreed, including replacing the Council Tax with a local income tax to fund a proportion of local government revenue. He developed a reputation among some journalists as an effective and forceful critic of some aspects of the Scottish Government's policy and performance, especially at First Minister's Question Time.[11]Along with Wendy Alexander and Annabel Goldie, he took his party into the Commission on Scottish Devolution chaired by Sir Kenneth Calman, but was opposed to any suggestion that this would result in powers of the Parliament being returned to Westminster.[12]
Resignation as party leader[edit]
On 2 July 2008, Nicol Stephen announced he was stepping down as party leader with immediate effect because of the pressures of leading a political party while having a young family based in Aberdeen, some distance from Parliament in Edinburgh. Nicol Stephen's resignation took many in Scottish politics by surprise, and came only four days after the resignation of the former leader of Labour in the Scottish Parliament, Wendy Alexander. He was succeeded by Tavish Scott.[13]On 24 September 2010, Nicol Stephen announced he would not be standing again at the Scottish elections in May 2011.

House of Lords[edit]
On 2 February 2011, he was created a life peer as Baron Stephen, of Lower Deeside in the City of Aberdeen,[14] and was introduced in the House of Lords on 7 February 2011,[15] where he sits on the Liberal Democrat benches. He said he would use his new position to help reform the House of Lords.[16]

Nicola Sturgeon's voice

Sturgeon's last statement in the Scottish Parliament as First MinisterRecorded 23 March 2023

Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon (born 19 July 1970) is a Scottish politician who served as First Minister of Scotland and Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2014 to 2023.[1][2] She has served as a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 1999, first as an additional member for the Glasgow electoral region, and as the member for Glasgow Southside (formerly Glasgow Govan) from 2007.
Born in Ayrshire, Sturgeon is a law graduate of the University of Glasgow, having worked as a solicitor in Glasgow before her election to the Scottish Parliament in 1999. She served successively as the SNP's shadow minister for education, health, and justice. Sturgeon entered the leadership of the SNP but later withdrew from the contest in favour of Alex Salmond, standing instead as depute leader on a joint ticket with Salmond. Both were subsequently elected; as Salmond was still an MP, Sturgeon led the SNP in the Scottish Parliament as Leader of the Opposition from 2004 to 2007. The SNP emerged as the largest party following the 2007 election and Salmond headed the first SNP minority government, with Sturgeon as his deputy. From 2007 to 2012, she served as the health secretary, overseeing the scrapping of prescription charges and the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Following the SNP's landslide majority in 2011, she was appointed as the Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Capital Investment and Cities, which saw her in charge of the legislative process for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign resulted in Salmond's resignation as SNP leader.
Sturgeon was elected unopposed as SNP leader in November 2014 and was subsequently appointed as first minister, becoming the first woman to hold either position.[3][4] She entered office amid a rapid surge in membership of the SNP, which was reflected in the party's performance in the 2015 general election, winning 56 of the 59 Scottish seats and replacing the Liberal Democrats as the third-largest party in the House of Commons. The SNP continued to enjoy electoral successes throughout Sturgeon's nine years in office, but lost 21 seats in the 2017 general election. Despite losing her majority, Sturgeon secured a second term in office in 2016, forming a minority government.

vteEarly life and education[edit]
Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon[5] was born in Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine on 19 July 1970.[6] She is the eldest of two daughters born to Joan Kerr Sturgeon (née Ferguson, born 23 October 1952[7]), a dental nurse, and Robin Sturgeon (born 28 September 1948[8]), an electrician.[9][10] Her younger sister, Gillian Sturgeon, is an NHS worker.[11] Her family has some roots in North East England; her paternal grandmother, Margaret Sturgeon (née Mill), was from Ryhope in what is now the City of Sunderland.[12] Her grandmother married Robert Sturgeon, a gardener from Ayr, at St Paul's Parish Church in 1943, and they both eventually moved back to the south west of Scotland. Sturgeon grew up in Prestwick and in the village of Dreghorn, in a terraced council house, which her parents bought through the right-to-buy scheme.[13]Sturgeon was a quiet child and has been described by her younger sister as ""the sensible one"" of the two.[14] Sturgeon was shy and has said that she ""much preferred to sit with my head in a book than talking to people"".[14] She developed a passion for books and reading which continued into adult life. She has described herself as being an ""austere"" teen whose style tended towards goth, adding that ""if you see pictures of me back then, you would struggle to know whether I was a boy or a girl"".[14] Sturgeon was a fan of Wham! and Duran Duran, and enjoyed spending Saturday nights at Frosty's Ice Disco in Irvine.[citation needed]Sturgeon attended Dreghorn Primary School from 1975 to 1982 and Greenwood Academy from 1982 to 1988.[citation needed] She later studied law at the University of Glasgow School of Law, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws (Hons) in 1992 and a Diploma in Legal Practice the following year.[citation needed] During her time at the University of Glasgow she was active as a member of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association and the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council.[citation needed]
Legal career[edit]
Following her graduation, Sturgeon completed her legal traineeship at McClure Naismith, a Glasgow firm of solicitors, in 1995. After qualifying as a solicitor, she worked for Bell & Craig, a firm of solicitors in Stirling, and later at the Drumchapel Law Centre and a Money Advice Centre in Glasgow from 1997 until her election to the Scottish Parliament in 1999.[15][16]
Early parliamentary career[edit]
Early political years[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 1999In her early teens, Sturgeon joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and in 1986, at the age of 16, she became a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), quickly becoming the party's Youth Affairs Vice Convener and Publicity Vice Convener. She joined the SNP following an assumption by her English teacher, who was a Labour councillor, she would be a Labour supporter. In the 1987 UK General election, Sturgeon got her first taste of campaigning, going door-to-door to get her local SNP candidate, Kay Ullrich, elected to Westminster. Despite Ullrich failing to win the seat, Sturgeon ploughed her political energy into the Young Scottish Nationalists (now Young Scots for Independence), joining its national executive when she was 17.[17][18][19]
In an interview with the BBC's Woman's Hour, Sturgeon revealed that it was Margaret Thatcher who inspired her to enter politics, because, due to rising unemployment in Scotland at the time, she developed ""a strong feeling that it was wrong for Scotland to be governed by a Tory government that we hadn't elected""Thatcher was the motivation for my entire political career. I hated everything she stood for.— Nicola Sturgeon, Sturgeon's views on Margaret Thatcher
Sturgeon became the youngest ever parliamentary candidate in Scotland in the 1992 general election. Aged 21, Sturgeon was selected as the SNP candidate in the Glasgow Shettleston constituency. She was unsuccessful, having been beaten by almost 15,000 votes by Labour.[17] Sturgeon also stood unsuccessfully as the SNP candidate for the Irvine North ward on Cunninghame District Council in May 1992, for the Baillieston/Mount Vernon ward on Strathclyde Regional Council in 1994, and for the Bridgeton ward on Glasgow City Council in 1995.[citation needed]In the mid-1990s Sturgeon and Charles Kennedy went together on a political study visit to Australia.[21][22]The 1997 general election saw Sturgeon selected to fight the Glasgow Govan seat for the SNP. Boundary changes meant that the notional Labour majority in the seat had increased substantially. However, infighting between the two rival candidates for the Labour nomination, Mohammed Sarwar and Mike Watson, along with an energetic local campaign,[citation needed] resulted in Glasgow Govan being the only Scottish seat to see a swing away from Labour in the midst of a Labour landslide nationwide. Sarwar did, however, win the seat with a majority of 2,914 votes.[23] Shortly after this, Sturgeon was appointed as the SNP's spokesperson for energy and education matters.[citation needed]
SNP in opposition[edit]
Sturgeon speaking to the Scottish Parliament, 2003Sturgeon stood for election to the Scottish Parliament in the first Scottish Parliament election in 1999 as the SNP candidate for Glasgow Govan.[24] Although she failed to win the seat, she was placed first in the SNP's regional list for the Glasgow region, and was thus elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament. The SNP emerged as the second largest party and sat in opposition to the Labour-Lib Dem coalition. In Alex Salmond's shadow cabinet, she served as Shadow Minister for Children and Education from 1999 to 2000.
As Shadow Education minister, Sturgeon backed Labour's efforts to repeal Section 28 – a Westminster law that banned the promotion of homosexuality in schools. There was, however, significant public opposition to repeal and an unscientific postal vote on the issue – organised by SNP donor Brian Souter – suggested most Scots wanted to keep the clause. Acknowledging this, Sturgeon suggested: ""That is why the SNP have urged a policy for many months that we believe can provide people with the necessary reassurance, by providing a statutory underpinning to the guidelines, and resolve this difficult debate. We believe that the value of marriage should be clearly referred to in the guidelines, without denigrating other relationships or children brought up in other kinds of relationship."" The compromise had the support of Souter but an amendment to that effect was voted down by MSPs who expressed concerns it would stigmatise children from single parent and unmarried families.[25]Sturgeon served as Shadow Minister for Health and Community Care from 2000 to 2003, and Shadow Minister for Justice from 2003 to 2004. She also served as a member of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee and the Health and Community Care Committee.[26]
2004 SNP leadership election[edit]
See also: 2004 Scottish National Party leadership election
Sturgeon and Alex Salmond in 2007On 22 June 2004, John Swinney resigned as Leader of the SNP following poor results in the European Parliament election. His then-depute, Roseanna Cunningham, immediately stood for the leadership. The previous leader, Alex Salmond, at the time refused to stand.[27] On 24 June 2004, Sturgeon also entered the leadership contest, with Kenny MacAskill as her running mate.[28] The political columnist Iain Macwhirter declared that while she ""didn't inspire great warmth"", she was ""quick on her feet, lacks any ideological baggage and has real determination – unlike... Roseanna Cunningham"".[29]However, once Cunningham emerged as the favourite to win,[29] Salmond entered the contest and Sturgeon subsequently withdrew from the contest and declared her support for Salmond, standing instead as his running mate for the depute leadership. It was reported that Salmond had privately supported Sturgeon in her leadership bid, but decided to run for the position himself as it became apparent she was unlikely to beat Cunningham.[30] The majority of the SNP hierarchy lent their support to the Salmond–Sturgeon bid for the leadership, although MSP Alex Neil backed Salmond as leader, but refused to endorse Sturgeon as depute.[31]On 3 September 2004, the leadership contest resulted in Salmond and Sturgeon elected as Leader and Depute Leader respectively.[32] As Salmond was still an MP in the House of Commons, Sturgeon led the SNP at the Scottish Parliament until the 2007 election, when Salmond was elected as an MSP.[33]
Leader of the Opposition; 2004–2007[edit]
As leader of the SNP in the Scottish Parliament, she served as the Leader of the Opposition in Holyrood. Sturgeon became a high-profile figure in Scottish politics and often clashed with First Minister Jack McConnell at First Minister's Questions. This included rows over the House of Commons' decision to replace the Trident nuclear weapon system, and the SNP's plans to replace council tax in Scotland with a local income tax.[34] Sturgeon quickly grew a reputation in Holyrood as opposition leader, becoming known as ""nippy sweetie"" – Scottish slang for the ""sharp-tongued and strong-minded"".[35]
Deputy First Minister of Scotland (2007–2014)[edit]

Sturgeon served as Deputy First Minister in Alex Salmond's administrations.In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Sturgeon defeated Gordon Jackson QC[a] with a 4.7% swing to the SNP in the Glasgow Govan constituency.[36][37] This was one of many swings to the SNP, as the party emerged as the largest party, winning one seat more than the governing Scottish Labour Party.[38][39] Although the SNP was recognised as the winners of the election, it failed to obtain a majority and Labour was not willing to allow the SNP to enter government.[40] Sturgeon led coalition negotiation talks between the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens, but these talks failed to reach an agreement, with the Lib Dems backing out and the Greens instead supporting a 'confidence and supply' agreement.[41] Ultimately, Salmond formed a minority government and he was appointed First Minister of Scotland.[42][43] He appointed Sturgeon as Deputy First Minister and tasked her with the Cabinet position of Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing.[44]Health Secretary (2007–2012)[edit]
Sturgeon as Deputy First Minister speaking at Fort William, 2011Sturgeon served as Health Secretary in Salmond's first, and for a year, in his second cabinet.[45] She was supported in her role as Health Secretary by Shona Robison, the Minister for Public Health and Sport, and by Alex Neil, the Minister for Housing and Communities. She launched her programme for government, the Better Health, Better Care: Action Plan, which settled a new vision for NHS Scotland.[46] She reversed the decision to close casualty units at University Hospital Ayr and University Hospital Monklands.[47] Sturgeon oversaw the scrapping of prescription charges In Scotland, an election pledge by the SNP originally for the chronically ill and those with cancer.[48][49]
Health policy[edit]
Sturgeon also outlined a guaranteed maximum 18-week wait for patients after they had seen their GP and vowed to do away with deferred or ""hidden"" waiting lists. She ordered a review of the thorny issue of hospital car parking charges – as high as £7 in some areas – and launched an inquiry into the infection of NHS patients with Hepatitis C and HIV from tainted blood products.[47]
2009 swine flu pandemic[edit]
Further information: 2009 swine flu pandemic in the United Kingdom
As Health Secretary, Sturgeon became more widely known internationally for her handling of the 2009 flu pandemic.[50][51]On 26 April 2009, the Scottish Government confirmed that two people who had returned from Mexico had been admitted to Monklands Hospital in Airdrie after experiencing ""mild flu-like symptoms"".[52] Sturgeon stated that there was ""no immediate threat to public health in Scotland"", but added, ""monitoring of those who have been in close contact with the two people is also being carried out as an additional precaution.""[53] The following day, she confirmed that these were cases of the swine influenza A (H1N1) virus.[54] Authorities in both Scotland and England stated that there were no plans to trace the fellow airline passengers who may have travelled alongside the couple, since the authorities do not classify them as ""close contacts"".[55][56]On 11 June, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the influenza virus a pandemic.[57] Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that containment of the virus had failed and that the Scottish Government was taking steps to mitigate the spread of the virus. ""We have seen a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Scotland over the past 10 days"", she told Parliament. ""Based on this experience, Health Protection Scotland has expressed the view that sustained community transmission appears to be taking place.""[58] Four days later, a Scottish woman with underlying health conditions died at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.[59][60] This marked the first death in Scotland and Europe.[61]
Minimum pricing unit[edit]

See also: Alcohol in Scotland
To tackle Scotland's poor relationship with alcohol, Sturgeon passed legislation to increase the price of alcohol per unit to help reduce sales, in particular, for those addicted.[62] In June 2012, the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 was passed after receiving support from the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Greens. Labour refused to support the bill as they claimed it failed to tackle windfall profit from alcohol retailers.[63]
Infrastructure Secretary (2012–2014)[edit]
Sturgeon with Alex Salmond, Michael Moore and David Cameron at St Andrews House following the signing of the Edinburgh Agreement, October 2012At the 2011 election, the SNP won a large overall majority. Sturgeon was retained as Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing until a reshuffle one year later, when she was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Capital Investment and Cities and an additional role overseeing the referendum on Scottish independence, essentially putting her in charge of the SNP's referendum campaign.[64]In 2012 she pledged to build a high-speed railway line between Glasgow and Edinburgh by 2024, cutting journey times between the two cities to under 30 minutes.[65] Sturgeon said the Scottish Government would ""not wait"" for Westminster to build a high-speed line to Scotland. However, in 2016 the plan was abandoned and the Scottish Government blamed Westminster.[66]
2014 Scottish independence referendum[edit]
Main article: 2014 Scottish independence referendum
See also: Edinburgh Agreement (2012) and Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013
Sturgeon signing the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill, 2013Salmond put Sturgeon in charge of the Scottish Government's legislative process for a referendum on Scottish Independence and she was essentially in charge of the SNP's referendum campaign.[64]In December 2012, Sturgeon said that she believed that independence would allow Scotland to build a stronger and more competitive country, and would change spending priorities to address ""the scandal of soaring poverty in a country as rich as Scotland"".[67]While campaigning for a Yes vote in August 2013, she told The Guardian that if Scots voted for the Union: ""Will there be another referendum round the corner? No. We can't bind our successors, but we've made very clear our belief that constitutional referenda are once-in-a-generation events.""[68]In November 2013, Sturgeon joined Salmond to launch Scotland's Future – the Scottish Government's prospectus for independence.[69] Sturgeon was one of the white paper's most high-profile media champions and frequently debated its contents with opposition politicians and sceptical Scots. When the British Government turned down the Scottish Government's idea of a formal currency union – on the grounds that the rationale for sharing a currency with a foreign country was ""not clear"" – Sturgeon accused Westminster of trying to ""bully Scotland"" and said it would ""cost their own businesses hundreds of millions in transaction costs"".[70][71]During the campaign, the European Commission said that if Scots decided to leave the United Kingdom, it would also mean leaving the European Union. Scotland would then have to reapply for EU membership and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso predicted this would be ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"".[72] In July 2014 Sturgeon said this would put at risk the right of EU citizens to continue living in Scotland: ""There are 160,000 EU nationals from other states living in Scotland, including some in the Commonwealth Games city of Glasgow. If Scotland was outside Europe, they would lose the right to stay here.""[73][74]On 19 September 2014, independence was rejected in the Scottish independence referendum, with 55.3% of the voters voting no and 44.7% voting yes.[75] Following the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign, Salmond resigned as First Minister and Leader of the SNP. Sturgeon immediately entered the election to replace him, and received huge support from the SNP hierarchy.[76][77][78] Sturgeon said that there would be ""no greater privilege"" than to lead the SNP. On Salmond's resignation, Sturgeon said:

The personal debt of gratitude I owe Alex is immeasurable. He has been my friend, mentor and colleague for more than 20 years. Quite simply, I would not have been able to do what I have in politics without his constant advice, guidance and support through all these years. [...] I can think of no greater privilege than to seek to lead the party I joined when I was just 16. However, that decision is not for today.
Following the referendum defeat, Sturgeon said that ""further devolution is the route to independence"".[79] She also opined that Scottish independence was a matter of ""when, not if"".[80]
Leadership of the Scottish National Party[edit]
Sturgeon outside Bute House in Edinburgh upon her appointment as First Minister, 2014On 24 September 2014, Sturgeon officially launched her campaign bid to succeed Salmond as Leader of the Scottish National Party at the November leadership election.[81][82] It quickly became apparent that no other candidate would be able to receive enough required nominations to run a credible leadership campaign.[83] Upon launching her campaign, Sturgeon also resigned as Depute Leader, triggering a concurrent depute leadership election; the MSPs Angela Constance and Keith Brown and the MP Stewart Hosie all nominated themselves to succeed Sturgeon as Depute Leader.[84][85]Nominations for the SNP leadership closed on 15 October, with Sturgeon confirmed as the only candidate. SNP convener Derek Mackay publicly congratulated Sturgeon as de facto leader in waiting, saying that she would be ""a fantastic new leader"" for both the SNP and for Scotland.[86] On this date, Sturgeon also came out on top in a trust rating opinion poll, conducted for the SNP, which indicated that 54% of the Scottish population trusted her to ""stand up for Scotland's interests"".[87]At a speech in Dundee's Caird Hall on 7 November, Sturgeon pledged to be ""the most accessible First Minister ever"" when she took over. She also promised to hold a monthly Facebook question and answer session with members of the public, regular town hall meetings and that the Scottish Cabinet would meet outside Edinburgh once every two months.[88]Sturgeon was formally acclaimed as the first female Leader of the SNP on 14 November 2014 at the Autumn Conference in Perth, with Hosie as her depute. This also made her First Minister-Designate, given the SNP's absolute majority in the Scottish Parliament.[89] In her first speech as leader, Sturgeon said that it was ""the privilege of her life"" to lead the party she joined as a teenager.[90]Although Salmond officially tendered his resignation as First Minister on 18 November 2014, Sturgeon was not sworn in until two days later. From 18 November until her official appointment on 20 November, she served as the acting First Minister, essentially the First Minister-elect.[91]

First term (2014–2016)[edit]
On 20 November 2014, Sturgeon was sworn into office at the Court of Session in a ceremony presided by Lord Gill,[92][93] after receiving the royal warrant of appointment by Queen Elizabeth II.[94] She became the first woman to hold office.[95][96] During her first First Minister's Questions after being sworn in, Sturgeon tried to strike a conciliatory tone, saying that she came into her new post ""with an open mind and a willingness to hear proposals from all sides of the chamber.""[97]
First cabinet[edit]
Sturgeon's first cabinet outside Bute House, 21 November 2014Sturgeon began making appointments to her first cabinet on 21 November 2014, beginning with the appointment of finance secretary John Swinney to become her Deputy First Minister.[98]Shona Robison, a close ally to Sturgeon, became the health secretary, while Keith Brown and Angela Constance, who were both unsuccessful in their bids for the deputy leadership of the SNP, were appointed infrastructure secretary and education secretary, respectively. Michael Matheson was promoted as justice secretary.[99]The departure of Kenny MacAskill and Michael Russell signalled a generational shift away from the ""79 group"". Alex Neil, who many speculated would be dismissed, remained in cabinet but in a ""less prominent portfolio"" of social justice, communities and pensioners' rights.[100]Roseanna Cunningham, who had difficult relationship with Sturgeon, was surprisingly promoted to cabinet as the fair work secretary. Fiona Hyslop and Richard Lochhead remained in their portfolios of culture secretary and rural affairs secretary, respectively.[101]
Sturgeon's cabinet was 50/50 gender balance, with five men and five women, including herself.[102]Sturgeon and Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street, 14 December 20152015 Westminster landslide[edit]
Further information: 2015 United Kingdom general election in ScotlandSturgeon led the Scottish National Party through a landslide victory in the 2015 UK general election, winning 56 out of 59 Scottish seats at Westminster, the party's best ever performance.[103] The party received 50% of the vote share in Scotland and replaced the Liberal Democrats as the third largest party in the British House of Commons.[104] Sturgeon had stated that the party's success in the election was not a mandate for another independence referendum, but primarily for a stronger voice for Scotland in London.[105]In the run-up to the elections, Sturgeon took part in several Scottish and UK-wide TV election debates and according to opinion polls was regarded to have had a successful performance.[106] As part of the election campaign, Sturgeon indicated that the SNP would hold another independence referendum if it won the upcoming 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[107][108]
2016 Scottish Parliament election[edit]
Sturgeon launched, in what she claimed, as the most ""bold, ambitious and reforming"" SNP manifesto for the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[109] She set out the party's plans to increase income tax by freezing tax thresholds, reversing her previous policy of cutting taxes for higher earners.[110] The manifesto also included a commitment to increase NHS funding by £500 million, ""baby boxes"" full of essentials to newborn parents, and an ambitious new target to cut emissions by 50% by 2020 as of the party's effort to tackle climate change.[111] Sturgeon also hinted if re-elected she would hold a second referendum on Scottish independence.[112]Despite losing her majority, Sturgeon claimed a ""historic victory"" after the SNP won a third consecutive term in government[113] and sought a second term in office as a minority government.[114][115][116]
Second term in office portrait, 2016Second term (2016–2021)[edit]
2016 EU membership referendum[edit]
In 2016, the European Union membership referendum to decide the future of the UK's European Union membership resulted in 52% of voters in the UK voting for Brexit (leaving the EU), with 48% voting to remain; all council areas in Scotland voted by a majority for the UK to remain a member of the EU. Across Scotland, 62% of voters backed the UK remaining a member of the EU, with 38% voting for the UK to leave.[117]In response to the result, on 24 June 2016, Sturgeon said that Scottish Government officials would begin planning for a second independence referendum.[118][119] Sturgeon claimed that it was ""clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union"" and that Scotland had ""spoken decisively"" with a ""strong, unequivocal"" vote to remain in the European Union.[120] Sturgeon said it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland could be taken out of the EU ""against its will"".[121] An emergency Scottish cabinet meeting on 25 June agreed that the Scottish Government would seek to enter negotiations with the EU and its member states, to explore options to protect Scotland's place in the EU.[122][123] Sturgeon later said that while she believed in Scottish independence, her starting point in these discussions was to protect Scotland's relationship with the EU.[124]
Future referendum on independence[edit]
Sturgeon confirmed in June 2016 that the Scottish government had formally agreed to draft legislation to allow a second independence referendum to take place.[125] As the constitution is a reserved matter under the Scotland Act 1998, for a future referendum on Scottish independence to be legal under UK law, it would need to receive the consent of the British Parliament to take place.[126]Prior to the day the Prime Minister triggered Article 50, formally allowing the process of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Scottish Parliament voted 69 to 59 in favour of another independence referendum.[127] By the end of that week, on 30 March 2017, Sturgeon wrote to the Prime Minister requesting a Section 30 order, formally devolving the responsibility and power to the Scottish Government to plan for and hold another referendum on Scottish independence.[128] Previously, May and David Mundell, Secretary of State for Scotland, had both highlighted that as the negotiations began with the European Union on the United Kingdom's withdraw, it was important for Scotland to work with the UK Government to get the best exit deal for both the United Kingdom and Scotland, stating that ""now is not the time for another referendum"".[129]Following the 2017 UK general election, Sturgeon's government postponed legislation pertaining to the proposed second referendum on Scottish independence until at least autumn 2018.[130] Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, all plans for another referendum were put on hold.[citation needed]
2017 UK general election[edit]
Main article: 2017 United Kingdom general electionSturgeon and Prime Minister, Theresa May, at Bute House in Edinburgh, 2016Sturgeon kicked off her election campaign pledging that a strong result for the SNP would ""reinforce"" her mandate for a second independence referendum.[131] However, the SNP lost 21 seats in the 2017 United Kingdom general election in Scotland and the party's vote dropped by 13%, although they remained the biggest party in Scotland. Sturgeon admitted that these results were ""bitterly disappointing"" and acknowledged that her party's plans for a second referendum were 'undoubtedly' a factor in the election results.[132] It was the best result for the Scottish Conservatives since Margaret Thatcher and the party's campaign slogan, ""We said No to independence. We meant it"", resonated in areas that had voted strongly for the Union in 2014.[133] Observers also concluded that opposition to the EU's Common Fisheries Policy in coastal communities was a factor behind large swings to the Tories in North East seats previously held by nationalists for decades.[134][135]Several weeks later Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament that she would ""reset"" and delay her plans for a second independence referendum; the SNP losses in that month's election had led her to conclude that many Scots ""just want a break from making big political decisions"".[136][137]
Alex Salmond sexual harassment case[edit]
Main article: Alex Salmond scandal
Sturgeon and Alex Salmond at the launch of National Conversation, 2007In January 2019, Sturgeon referred herself to an independent ministerial ethics body, which led to an investigation into her actions with respect to a sexual harassment case concerning allegations against Salmond. This followed her admitting that she had had a secret meeting and subsequent phone call with Salmond about the Scottish government's allegations against him. She raised these with the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government, Leslie Evans, two months later, rather than reporting them immediately, as she should have done if they constitute government matters (as per the ministerial code). Sturgeon argued that the meetings were SNP party matters, and thus not covered. The investigating panel consisted of Dame Elish Angiolini, a former Solicitor General for Scotland and lord advocate, and James Hamilton, a former director of public prosecutions in the Republic of Ireland.[138]On 15 January 2019, the Scottish Parliament agreed to hold its own inquiry into the matter, the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints,[139] to investigate how the Government breached its own guidelines in its original investigation into the harassment claims against Salmond, and then lost a judicial review into their actions and had to pay over £500,000 to Salmond for legal expenses.[140][141] Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, was called to this inquiry to give evidence on 8 December 2020.[142] Opposition parties criticised Sturgeon on disparity and contradictions between the narratives of Murrell and herself.[143]On 4 March 2021, Sturgeon answered questions over a period of eight hours from members of the committee.[144] Two of the civil servants who made complaints about Salmond later said they felt they had been ""dropped"" by the Scottish Government after it lost the judicial review against him, adding they feared their experiences would make it less likely people would make complaints in the future.[145] Labour MP Jess Phillips, a former employee of Women's Aid, accused Sturgeon of being ""unprofessional with those women's lives"" and said there had been a ""litany of failures in professionalism and decency.""[146]
2019 UK general election[edit]
Main article: 2019 United Kingdom general election
UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and Sturgeon at Bute House, 2019Sturgeon led her party to a landslide victory in the 2019 United Kingdom general election in Scotland. The SNP won 48 seats, and came second place in the 11 others; their 45% of the vote yielded 80% of the seats in Scotland.[147] Among the election casualties was Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson, who lost her seat in East Dunbartonshire. Sturgeon was branded as ""ungracious"" when she was filmed by Sky News celebrating Swinson's defeat. Sturgeon apologised for being overexcited although expressed that she was celebrating Amy Callaghan's win.[148][149][150][151] In the wake of the results, Sturgeon said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""no right"" to stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum after an ""overwhelming"" SNP election victory. She also said that the result ""renews, reinforces and strengthens"" the mandate for Indyref2.[152]COVID–19 pandemic[edit]
Further information: COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland
Sturgeon at a Scottish Government daily COVID-19 briefingThe worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 began during Sturgeon's second term as First Minister. The first case of the virus in Scotland was confirmed on 1 March 2020, when a resident in Tayside had tested positive.
Initially, the Scottish Government resisted banning public events and on 12 March allowed 47,000 fans to attend a Rangers match at Ibrox, insisting that, ""stopping mass gatherings [is] not the best way to contain this virus.""[153] However, Sturgeon's government ordered all schools and nurseries in Scotland closed on 20 March to try to limit the spread of the virus.[154] On 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Sturgeon ordered Scotland into ""lockdown"", limiting the reasons why people may leave their homes in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, to protect the health of the population, and to ease the pressure the virus placed on NHS Scotland services and workforce.[155][156][157] Subsequently the restrictions were repeatedly tightened, loosened and adapted in parts or all of Scotland in response to developments in the situation.[158]
During the early stages of the pandemic 1,300 elderly hospital patients were transferred into care homes without receiving a negative coronavirus test result.[159] Many had been infected with the virus and ended up passing it on to other care home residents.[160] Over three thousand care home residents died from COVID-19[161] and Gary Smith, Scotland Secretary of the GMB, said the policy had turned ""care homes into morgues"".[161] When asked by the BBC if the policy had been a mistake, Sturgeon said: ""Looking back on that now, with the knowledge we have now and with the benefit of hindsight, yes.""[162]Sturgeon speaking virtually at the British-Irish Council Summit 2020In April 2020 whistle-blowers in the NHS came forward to reveal that staff were being made to reuse dirty personal protective equipment (PPE) while at work. One nurse told STV, ""[When we hear the government say supplies are fine] it's not frustrating, it's crushing. It is absolutely crushing. We feel we are being lied to.""[163] Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament in July, ""At no point within this crisis has Scotland run out of any aspect of PPE. We have worked hard to make sure that supplies are there, we've worked hard overcoming challenges that we have faced along the way.""[164]In July 2020, Sturgeon advocated that the leaders of the four UK nations adopt a coordinated Zero-COVID strategy.[165]In February 2021 Audit Scotland published a report that concluded the Scottish Government had not prepared adequately for a pandemic. While it commended the authorities for preventing hospitals from becoming overwhelmed during the crisis, the watchdog also noted that recommendations from pandemic planning exercises in 2015, 2016 and 2018 had not been fully implemented. One particular problem it highlighted was that not enough had been done to ensure Scottish hospitals and care homes had enough personal protective equipment. Overall, it concluded that ministers ""could have been better prepared to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic"". Sturgeon said there were ""lots of lessons to learn"".[166][167]In March 2021, the Court of Session declared that the Scottish Government's prohibition on communal worship, imposed during the pandemic, was unlawful.[168] This followed an open letter two months earlier, written by 200 church leaders to Sturgeon, warning her that the prohibition could be unlawful.[169]In April 2021 Scotland's death toll from COVID-19 passed 10,000.[170][171]At a session of First Minister's Questions in June 2021, Sturgeon was asked about mistakes made early on in the pandemic and she replied: ""If I could turn the clock back, would we go into lockdown earlier than we did? Yes, I think that is true.""[153]In April 2022 Sturgeon demanded that Prime Minister Boris Johnson resign after police fined him for breaking lockdown rules in 2020. ""The basic values of integrity and decency – essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy – demand that he go"", she tweeted.[172][173] The following week Sturgeon received an official reprimand from Police Scotland after a video emerged of her campaigning in a barber shop without a mask. Sturgeon – who had previously apologised to the Scottish Parliament after she was caught breaking the same law in December 2020[174] – apologised once more and said the police had been ""absolutely right to treat me no differently to any other citizen.""[175][176][177]
Third term (2021–23)[edit]
Sturgeon meets Prime Minister of Vietnam Phạm Minh Chính, 2021Sturgeon led the SNP into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election on a manifesto promise to hold a second independence referendum after the COVID-19 pandemic was over.[178] In the election, the SNP won 64 of the 129 seats contested.[179] The SNP won a fourth consecutive election, albeit short of an overall majority, with a record number of votes on both the constituency and regional vote[failed verification] as well as increasing their share of the constituency vote and making a net gain of one seat.[179][180]Sturgeon was nominated for the post of First Minister by a vote of the Scottish Parliament on 18 May, defeating Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie by 64 votes to 31 and 4 respectively. This win resulted in Sturgeon becoming the first First Minister in the history of the Scottish Parliament to form a third government. Shortly after being elected, Sturgeon appointed John Swinney to the newly created position of Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery.[181]
Power-sharing agreement[edit]
See also: Scottish National Party–Scottish Greens agreement
In August 2021, Sturgeon and Scottish Green Party co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater reached a power-sharing agreement between their parties. There was no agreement on oil and gas exploration, but the government now argued that it had a stronger case for a national independence referendum.[182] As part of the agreement, the Green Party co-leaders would be nominated to serve as ministers.[183]
Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas, President of Tanzania Samia Suluhu Hassan, and Sturgeon at the UN's COP26, November 2021Climate crisis[edit]
In August 2021, confonted by climate activist Lauren Macdonald about the Cambo oil field west of Shetland, Sturgeon refused to take a position on whether its development should go ahead. A video of the interaction went viral[4] and a few days later, Sturgeon wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, asking that the development of Cambo should be ""reassessed in light of the severity of the climate emergency"".[184] The letter represented a significant shift in policy for the SNP, which had historically been a strong supporter of the oil and gas industry; the party's blueprint for an independent Scotland in 2013 was predicated on tax revenue earned from domestic oil production, while Sturgeon had predicted in the run-up to the referendum that, ""We're on the verge of another North Sea bonanza"".[185]This shift in position was welcomed by the Scottish Green party but Greenpeace criticised Sturgeon for not coming out more strongly against the oil field. ""The First Minister must stop hiding behind Boris Johnson"", a spokesperson for the organisation said. ""If she wants to show leadership on climate she must clearly say: stop Cambo.""[186] In November 2021, although no assessment had taken place, Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she believed the oilfield ""should not get the green light"".[187]
Caledonian MacBrayne ferry delay[edit]
See also: Ferry fiasco
In the late 2010s, Scottish islanders began to complain that the ageing ferry fleet that connected them to the mainland had become increasingly unreliable.[188][189][190][191] During the winter of 2022 only one in three sailings to the island of Coll went ahead;[192] Hebridean shopkeepers kept receiving deliveries of rotten food;[193][194]
while other islanders said they had missed doctors' appointments, funerals and even the chance to say goodbye to dying loved ones because of cancelled sailings.[195][196][197]The Scottish Government had commissioned two new ferries for £97m from Ferguson's shipyard in 2015, but the construction of the two vessels was beset by delays and complications. In 2022 Audit Scotland concluded that the final price tag for the vessels would be somewhere between £250m and £400m once the ships were finished in 2023. Furthermore, they concluded that the Scottish Government had awarded the contracts without normal financial safeguards and presided over a ""multitude of failings"".[198][199][200]Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament of her ""deep regret"" that islanders were enduring such chaos and said that the Government was ""learning lessons from this experience"".[201][202][200] Key documentation, which might have explained why ministers signed the contracts without appropriate safeguards to protect taxpayers' money, was lost and Sturgeon later said this too was ""regrettable"" and that ""the Government will learn lessons.""[203][204][205][206]
Second independence referendum proposals[edit]
Rishi Sunak is the fifth British prime minister to serve during Sturgeon's premiership and like his predecessors has rejected calls for a second referendum.In June 2022, Sturgeon officially unveiled plans for Scottish independence once again.[207] She argued that her government had an ""indisputable mandate"" for a second Scottish independence referendum. She argued that independence would allow Scotland to set out ""a different and better vision""[208][209] and claimed that there is a legally secure path to get a referendum without permission from the cabinet.[210] This plan has been met with condemnation from various opposing parties, with the Prime Minister rejecting her plan.[211]Sturgeon scheduled the referendum for 19 October 2023.[212] She sought the Prime Minister to consent to the vote by signing a section 30 order, a move that Downing Street has refused to comply.[213] She asked Scotland's Lord Advocate to consider referring the matter to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom to rule if the Scottish Government has the power to host a referendum without the Government of the United Kingdom's approval, this request has since been granted.[213][214]In October 2022, Sturgeon launched her government's third independence paper, which outlines the currency in an independent Scotland and joining the EU.[215] She proposed the Scottish Government would use the pound sterling for a brief period before transitioning to a new currency known as the 'Scottish Pound'.[216][217] She argued independence would be ""essential"" for economic prosperity for Scotland as she claimed the economic climate throughout the UK does not offer strength, stability or security.[218][219]On the day the Supreme Court ruled the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate a referendum on independence, Sturgeon declared the next democratic election in Scotland - in this case a UK general election expected to be held in 2024 - would be campaigned by the SNP as a de facto referendum.[220][221] Unionist parties have rejected this characterisation.[222][223] Some SNP members have urged Sturgeon to call an early election at Holyrood to speed up the process for a de facto referendum.[224]
Gender recognition reforms[edit]
See also: Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill
As part of the SNP's 2016 manifesto policy, the SNP pledged to voters review and reform the way that trans people change their legal gender.[225] However, the policy divided the party and it the bill was delayed during Sturgeon's second term in office because of opposition to the policy and the COVID-19 pandemic.[226][227][228] In the 2021 SNP manifesto, Sturgeon committed the party once again to reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004 of the UK Parliament and in August that year included the commitment in her agreement with the Scottish Greens on power-sharing.[229][230]In September 2021, Sturgeon was accused of shutting down debate about gender reforms after she described concerns about gender recognition reform as ""not valid"" and campaign groups and analysts complained that their concerns were being ignored.[231]On 22 December 2022, the Scottish Parliament voted 86 to 39 to pass the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill which was introduced by Sturgeon's government. On 17 January 2023, the UK Government decided to invoke, for the first time, section 35 of the Scottish Act 1998, to make an order which prevented the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill from gaining Royal Assent. She opposed the decision made and criticised Scottish Secretary Alister Jack for blocking the bill and said that the decision was an attack on the Scottish Parliament and Scottish democracy as a whole and said that the matter would be brought to the courts.[232]In 2023, Sturgeon was criticised in connection with the case of Isla Bryson, a transgender woman who had raped two women prior to her transition. On this basis, Bryson was initially sent to a women's prison but was later moved to a men's prison. Sturgeon refused to say if she regards Bryson as a man or woman, though she used female pronouns when talking about Bryson.[233]
Resignation[edit]
Sturgeon resigns at a press conference in Bute House, 15 February 2023On 15 February 2023, Sturgeon resigned as first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, pending a leadership election.[234] At a press conference in Bute House, Sturgeon insisted that her resignation was not due to ""short term pressures"" and stated that the job ""takes its toll on you"".[235] Sturgeon stated that she believed that her successor would lead Scotland to independence and that she would look on with pride whoever takes on the role.[236]While appearing on a podcast for BBC Scotland, Sturgeon would later say that internet speculation about her life were a part of the reason she decided to stand down from her position as first minister, specifically referring to rumours regarding her sexuality, love life, and property portfolio as being wildly inaccurate.[237]
Domestic issues[edit]
Drugs deaths crisis[edit]
In 2016 the Scottish Government cut direct funding to drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes from £69.2 million to £53.8 million – a drop of 22%.[238][239] At the time, Scottish Drugs Forum Chief Executive David Liddell said he was concerned that the cuts had ""the potential to increase harm and drug-related deaths.""[238] That year 867 Scots lost their lives to drugs – an increase of 23% on the previous year's figure – and the SNP insisted it was part of a trend seen across much of Europe.[240] In December 2020 figures were released revealing that 1,264 people in Scotland had died from drug overdoses in 2019 – the highest number in Europe per head and more than double the number in 2014.[241] Sturgeon sacked her Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick and in April 2021 said of the crisis: ""I think we took our eye off the ball.""[242]The crisis has particularly impacted the homeless in Scotland: 216 homeless people died in Scotland in 2019 – an increase of 11% on the previous year; over half (54%) of these deaths were drug-related.[243] Per head, Scotland's death rate among the homeless is the highest in Britain.[244]In August 2021 the Scottish Government announced there had been 1,339 drug deaths in the previous year – a new record high.[245] Sturgeon tweeted that the figures were ""unacceptable, each one a human tragedy"",[246] while the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: ""It was Nicola Sturgeon's choice to ignore this unfolding epidemic. Issuing apologies now is too late for thousands of people. The victims of drugs and their families were failed. It is a scar on the conscience of this Scottish Government.""[247]In July 2022 the figures for 2021 were released, revealing that 1,330 had died – nine fewer than in 2020.[248] Annemarie Ward, chief executive at the FAVOR Scotland charity, said: ""Nicola Sturgeon said she would make it her national mission to save lives – but we're still losing more than 1000 people a year. The national mission is failing.""[249]
Education performance[edit]
In 2015, Sturgeon said that she planned to make education her ""defining priority"" while in office.[250] In particular, she said she hoped to focus on closing the attainment gap between the richest and poorest children in Scottish schools, telling journalists: ""Let me be clear – I want to be judged on this. If you are not, as First Minister, prepared to put your neck on the line on the education of our young people then what are you prepared to. It really matters.""[251]In 2021, Audit Scotland concluded that, ""Progress on closing the poverty-related attainment gap between the most and least deprived school pupils has been limited""[252] and fell short of the Government's aims.[253] In some local authorities the attainment gap between the richest and poorest students had widened.[253]
International relations[edit]
While foreign policy remains a reserved matter,[254] Sturgeon has undertaken a number of visits to Europe, North America and Asia to promote Scotland as a place of investment and Scottish businesses to trade and do business with.[255][256][257] Sturgeon has committed to strengthening links between Scotland and Africa.[258]
European Union[edit]
In response to the Brexit vote, to discuss Scotland's interests, Sturgeon travelled to Brussels to meet with both Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission as well as Martin Schulz, the President of the European Parliament.[259][260]Sturgeon and Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission in Brussels, 2017In response to the UK-wide vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, the Scottish Government, headed by Sturgeon, launched the Scotland's Place in Europe document, a white paper setting out the Scottish Government's aims and wishes of Scotland's role in Europe post-Brexit. The paper was sent to the central British Government to be read by Prime Minister Theresa May.
In June 2017, Sturgeon criticised the approaches taken by both Theresa May and the British Government towards the Brexit approach, claiming that May ""will struggle"" as she is a ""difficult person to build a rapport with"". In the same interview, Sturgeon committed to no independence referendum being held prior to the terms of a UK wide Brexit deal being agreed and presented.[261]With a view towards Brexit, Sturgeon demanded greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, arguing that Brexit is threatening Scotland's devolution settlement.[262] With London seeking to restrict immigration to the United Kingdom, she asserted that Scotland should be able to set its own immigration policy, as well as policies relating to employment and trade.[262]
United States[edit]
Sturgeon and Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in Glasgow, November 2021Sturgeon was highly critical of Donald Trump and his policies during the 2016 United States presidential election and had publicly backed his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.[263] Sturgeon highlighted her disapproval of his language and views relating to sexism and misogyny, and stated upon Trump's victory that she hopes ""Trump turns out to be a president different to the one he was during his campaign and reaches out to those who felt vilified by his campaign"".[264]Sturgeon had previously stripped Trump of his ambassadorial role for Scottish businesses with the Scottish Government in the aftermath of Trump's views of an outright ban of Muslims from entering the United States. Sturgeon claimed following comments made by Trump in relation to Muslims entering the United States that he was ""not fit"" for the ambassadorial role with the Scottish Government.[265]In May 2022, Sturgeon made a trip to the United States and met with controversial Republican member of Congress Robert Aderholt, a prominent anti-abortion supporter.[266][267]
Spain[edit]
In the run up to the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon offered her own personal backing and that of the Scottish Government to Catalonia in the holding of a referendum.[268] The Government of Spain criticised Sturgeon, claiming she had ""totally misunderstood"" the situation in Spain and Catalonia.[268] Sturgeon highlighted that Spain should follow ""the shining example"" that was created as part of the Edinburgh Agreement between the Scottish and British Governments that allowed Scotland to hold a legally binding referendum.[269]
Political positions[edit]
Constitutional affairs[edit]
Scottish independence[edit]
An advocate for Scottish independence, Sturgeon has campaigned for independence from the United Kingdom since her late teens. She was categorised in 2015 as part of the SNP's gradualist wing, which believed in achieving independence through accumulating the Scottish Parliament's powers from the UK Parliament over time.[270] In recent years, following the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign in 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, Sturgeon has aligned herself with the new gradualist wing, who believe in only holding a second referendum if there is clear public support, such as polling being over 60%, or if there is a material change in circumstances.[270][failed verification]
Monarch[edit]
Sturgeon with Queen Elizabeth II at the opening of the Borders Railway, 2015Sturgeon is a constitutional monarchist, telling journalists that it is ""a model that has many merits"".[271] On the day Queen Elizabeth II became Britain's longest reigning monarch, Sturgeon travelled with her to open the Borders Railway and told a crowd of well-wishers: ""She [The Queen] has carried out her duties with dedication, wisdom and an exemplary sense of public service. The reception she has received today, demonstrates that that admiration and affection is certainly felt here in Scotland.""[272]Following the death of the Queen Elizabeth II, Sturgeon led tributes to the Queen.[273] She described the Queen as the ""greatest constant in our national life"" and added her death was ""a day for reflection and remembrance"" and ""a day for giving thanks to The Queen for her devotion to duty and the decades of public service she gave to the people of Scotland.""[274][275]
Economic policy[edit]
She has at times been a critic of austerity, saying that the UK government's ""austerity economics"" is ""morally unjustifiable and economically unsustainable"".[276] However, in 2018 she endorsed her party's Growth Commission report that pledged to reduce an independent Scotland's budget deficit as a percentage of GDP[277] – something the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded meant ""continued austerity"".[278][279]
Social issues[edit]
Women's rights[edit]
Sturgeon has also campaigned on women's rights and gender equality, and is a self-described feminist; she has argued that Scotland's feminist movement is not simply symbolic, but ""sends a powerful signal about equality"".[280] She has hailed Scottish feminist economist Ailsa McKay as one of her inspirations.[281] She has at various points commented on the behaviour or attitudes of men towards women; publicly condemning Donald Trump,[282]Tony Abbott[283] and former Labour MSP Neil Findlay.[284] However, she defended her party's leader Alex Salmond from accusations of sexism. After Salmond had told Conservative MP Anna Soubry, ""Behave yourself, woman"" in 2015, Sturgeon said: ""The fundamental question, 'does that language indicate that Alex Salmond is sexist?' Absolutely not, there's no man I know who is less sexist.""[285][286][287]Commenting on the need for men to challenge their friends' misogynistic behaviour, Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament in 2021: ""I would say to all men in this chamber and all men across the country — challenge it [misogyny] if it's on the part of other men you may know, challenge your own behaviour and then let's collectively, as a society, turn the page and turn the corner so that women can live free of the fear of harassment, abuse, intimidation, violence and, in the worst cases, death.""[288][289]
Transgender rights[edit]
Sturgeon leading pride parade at Glasgow Pride 2018Ahead of the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Sturgeon pledged to review and reform the way that trans people change their legal gender.[225] However, proposed changes to Scotland's Gender Recognition Act that would have allowed people to change their identity through self-identification, rather than a medical process, were paused in June 2019.[227] Critics of the changes within the SNP had accused Sturgeon of being ""out of step"" on the issue, and expressed concerns that the reforms would be open to abuse and allow predatory men into women's spaces.[227][290] The Scottish Government said it had paused the legislation in order to find ""maximum consensus"" on the issue[227] and commentators described the issue as having divided the SNP like no other, with many dubbing the debate a ""civil war"".[291][292][226]In April 2020, the reforms were again delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[228]In January 2021, a former trans officer in the SNP's LGBT wing, Teddy Hope, quit the party, claiming it was one of the ""core hubs of transphobia in Scotland"".[293] Large numbers of LGBT activists followed suit and Sturgeon released a video message in which she said that transphobia is ""not acceptable"" and said she hoped they would re-join the party.[294][295]In the 2021 SNP manifesto, Sturgeon committed the party once again to reform the Gender Recognition Act[229] and in August that year included the commitment in her agreement with the Scottish Greens on power-sharing.[230] In September 2021, Sturgeon was accused of shutting down debate about gender reforms after she described concerns about gender recognition reform as ""not valid"" and campaign groups and analysts complained that their concerns were being ignored.[231]On 22 December 2022, the Scottish Parliament voted 86 to 39 to pass the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill which was introduced by Sturgeon's government, but the bill was vetoed by the UK Government.[232]In 2023, Sturgeon was criticised in connection with the Isla Bryson case, in which a transgender woman who had raped two women when named Adam Graham began self-identifying as a woman after being charged. Bryson was sent to a women's prison before being moved to a men's prison.[233] Sturgeon refused to say if she regards Bryson as a man or woman, though she used female pronouns when talking about Bryson.[233]
Nuclear weapons[edit]
Sturgeon has campaigned against replacing the Trident nuclear weapons system.[296]
Views on Conservative government policies[edit]
At the SNP's 2022 annual party conference in Aberdeen, Sturgeon stated ""I detest the Tories and everything they stand for"" in an interview on the BBC.[297][298] She was accused of using ""dangerous language"" and when asked if she regretted the comments, Sturgeon simply replied ""No"" and emphasised the point she detested Tory policies and not supporters or voters.[299][300][301][302]Sturgeon has been highly critical towards the leadership of Boris Johnson's government.[303] Following Johnson's appointment as British prime minister, she claimed he ""rambled"" in his first speech outside 10 Downing Street and suggested he was ""blame shifting"".[304][305] In July 2019, the prime minister met Sturgeon at her official residence, Bute House, where Johnson was ""booed and heckled"" by protesters.[306][307] This was the only occasion when he made a formal visit to Edinburgh as he declined future invites by the first minister.[308][309][310] Sturgeon claimed Johnson's ""fragile male ego"" stopped him from meeting her.[311][312] Sturgeon's attempts to request approval for a second referendum on Scottish independence were declined by the Johnson administration.[313] Speaking after Johnson had resigned in 2022, Sturgeon said that he was the only prime minister she had worked with who was ""a disgrace to the office"".[314][315]
Post premiership (2023–present)[edit]
Upon her resignation as First Minister, Sturgeon returned to the backbench, where she continues to serve as the MSP for Glasgow Southside.[316][317] On 7 September 2023, she made her first speech in parliament since her arrest.[318]
SNP finance fraud inquiry and arrest[edit]
See also: Operation Branchform
Sturgeon sits on the backbenches of the Scottish Parliament during Humza Yousaf's speech to the chamber after having been elected as her successor, 28 March 2023In the latter half of Sturgeon's leadership of the SNP, a Police Scotland fraud inquiry was launched over money that had been raised by the party for independence campaigning was spent properly.[319][320] She dismissed claims the investigation was a result of her resignation as party leader and first minister.[321][322][323] On 5 April 2023, Sturgeon's husband and the party's former chief executive, Peter Murrell, was arrested at their Glasgow residence and their home was searched amid the ongoing investigation.[324] The SNP's HQ in Edinburgh and several other addresses related to party officials were also searched by police.[325] Murrell was later released without charge and Sturgeon pulled out of a UN climate event.[326]On 16 April, a meeting of the party's ruling body in March 2021 was leaked by a member to the Daily Mail, which showed Sturgeon warn members to be ""very careful"" about suggesting claims there was financial problems within the SNP.[327][328] The following day, it was revealed Sturgeon would work remotely from parliament as a spokesperson stated: ""in order to ensure the focus of this week is on the new First Minister setting out his priorities for the people of Scotland, Ms Sturgeon has always intended to participate remotely and intends to return to Holyrood in the near future."".[329] In that same week, the SNP's treasurer, Colin Beatie, was arrested and later released without charge.[330] Beatie subsequently resigned from the role.[331] Sturgeon's successor, Humza Yousaf, has had calls by opposition for her party membership to be suspended, however, he has rejected these calls.[332]Large speculation that Sturgeon could be arrested for police questioning amid the ongoing inquiry[333][334][335] came to fruition when, on 11 June 2023, Sturgeon was arrested by Police Scotland over the investigation into the finances of her SNP party, which reportedly diverted £600,000 meant for the Scottish Independence campaign elsewhere.[336][337][338] She was released without charge pending further investigation later that day.[339]
Public image and legacy[edit]
At the beginning of Sturgeon's political career, she was often regarded as a ""nippy sweetie"", Scottish slang for the ""sharp-tongued and strong-minded"".[340][341][342] The term was used to describe Sturgeon's ""fierce"" attitude.[342]Sturgeon was elected leader of the SNP at a time in which the party enjoyed a surge in membership. In 2015, Sturgeon was described in a Daily Mail headline as the ""most dangerous woman in Britain"".[343][344][345] It followed her party's unprecedented gains in the 2015 general election, which questioned the future of the union.[346]Sturgeon plans to publish a memoir in 2025.[347]
Awards and acknowledgements[edit]
Sturgeon won the Scottish Politician of the Year Award in 2008, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2019.[348]Forbes magazine ranked Sturgeon as the 50th most powerful woman in the world in 2016 and 2nd in the United Kingdom.[349][350] She was recognized as one of the BBC's 100 women of 2014.[351] In 2015, BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour assessed Sturgeon to be the most powerful and influential woman in the United Kingdom.[352]
Personal life[edit]
Sturgeon attended Greenwood Academy, Dreghorn, from 1982 to 1988.Sturgeon lives in Broomhouse, Glasgow with her husband, Peter Murrell, who is the former chief executive officer of the SNP.[353][354][355] The couple have been in a relationship since 2003. They got engaged on 29 January 2010,[356] and were married on 16 July 2010 at Òran Mór in Glasgow.[357]Sturgeon is known for her love of fiction and says reading, ""gives me a lot of joy and helps with the stresses and strains of work"".[358][359]Her mother Joan was the SNP Provost of North Ayrshire council, where she was councillor for the Irvine East ward from 2007 until 2016.[360]In 2016, Sturgeon disclosed that she had miscarried five years previously.[361]In May 2022, Sturgeon tested positive for COVID-19. In line with Government guidance, she completed a self-isolation period.[362]

Biography[edit]

He was first elected in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election and shortly after was made Scottish Conservative spokesperson for community safety.[3][4] In the 2016 European Union membership referendum, he campaigned to leave the EU, stating he believed Scotland did not receive a good deal from the Common Agricultural Policy.[5]

Early life and career[edit]
Duncan-Glancy has a BSc in Psychology and an MSc in Health Psychology from the University of Stirling, and a Postgraduate certificate in Citizenship and Human Rights from Glasgow Caledonian University.[4] She sat on the Commission on Strengthening Local Democracy[5] and on the Commission on Parliamentary Reform.[6] Prior to her election, she worked in public health communications for NHS Health Scotland.[4]
Political career[edit]
Duncan-Glancy contested Glasgow North for the general elections in 2017 and 2019, but came second to Patrick Grady, the incumbent SNP MP. She received a 34.5% share of the vote in 2017 and a 31.4% share in 2019.[7]On 1 March 2021, despite not being a parliamentarian at the time, she became Scottish Labour's spokesperson for Social Security in the Scottish Parliament.[8][9]After being a Labour member for approximately twenty years, Duncan-Glancy became a Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP) in 2021. Duncan-Glancy stood in Glasgow Kelvin in 2021 and came third to SNP candidate Kaukab Stewart, but was elected on the Glasgow regional list on 8 May 2021.[10] She came third despite having to compose a campaign team virtually from scratch, after eleven members of Kelvin Labour executive committee had resigned and refused to campaign for Duncan-Glancy.[11]During the election count, Duncan-Glancy received significant coverage as she highlighted the issues disabled candidates face when she was denied access to the Glasgow vote count due to the venue's lack of accessibility.[9][12]

Personal detailsBorn (1973-03-18) 18 March 1973 (age 50)Vale of Leven, Dunbartonshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish GreensAlma materManchester Metropolitan UniversityWebsiteOfficial websitePatrick Harvie (born 18 March 1973) is a Scottish politician who has served as Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings, Active Travel and Tenants' Rights since 2021. He has served as one of two co-leaders of the Scottish Greens[a] since 2008, and is one of the first Green politicians in the UK to serve as a government minister. Harvie has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region since 2003.
Born in Dunbartonshire, Harvie attended the Manchester Metropolitan University, where he was a member of the Labour Party. From a young age he was active in politics, having attended a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament demo, while still in a pram.[1] Harvie worked for a sexual health organisation, which led him into campaigning for equality. His experience of campaigning to repeal Section 28, led him to join the Scottish Green Party. Harvie was elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2003 election, representing the Glasgow region.
In September 2008, Harvie was appointed as male co-convenor of the Scottish Greens, serving alongside Eleanor Scott, Martha Wardrop and Maggie Chapman. In 2019, following a constitutional change in the Green Party, he ran for co-leadership in the August election. He was elected alongside Lorna Slater. As Slater was not an MSP at the time, Alison Johnstone fulfilled her role within the Scottish Parliament, until May 2021. In August 2021, after entering a power-sharing agreement with the SNP, Harvie and Slater were both appointed to the Scottish Government as junior ministers, becoming the first Green Party politicians in the UK to serve in government.

Early life[edit]
Education and career[edit]
Patrick Harvie was born on 18 March 1973 in Vale of Leven, Dunbartonshire. He grew up in a very political household, and was taken to Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament demonstrations as a child.[2] Harvie describes his teenage self as ""Awkward, self-conscious, uncomfortable. I was always the small kid in class. Crap at sport. Speccy. Good marks""[2]Harvie attended Dumbarton Academy from 1984 to 1991. He then studied at Manchester Metropolitan University, where he was briefly a member of the Labour party.[3]Before being elected to the Scottish Parliament, Harvie worked within the Gay Men's Project at the sexual health organisation PHACE West, later PHACE Scotland and now part of the Terrence Higgins Trust. He was initially a youth worker and later as Development Worker for the Lanarkshire Health Board area. Although this work was principally concerned with HIV prevention, it also involved Harvie in equality campaigning. Harvie also had a spell as a civil servant, working with the Inland Revenue in Dumbarton.[4]
Early political years[edit]
@media screen and (max-width:640px){}

This new Scottish parliament felt like the doors were open. It felt like this new institution was doing something relevant to my community, that it was going to ultimately do the right thing and that it was doing it in an open and participative way.


— Harvie, speaking to The Times about his experience engaging with the Scottish Parliament as a campaigner


At a young age, Harvie became involved in politics, having first attended a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament demo with his mother, while still in a pram. When he was ten, he told his mother that one day he would become Prime Minister. During his years at university he was a member of the Labour Party.[1]Harvie was active in the campaign to repeal Section 2A of the Local Government Act, more commonly known as Section 28.[2] This campaign was successful, and he has stated that the experience prompted him to become more actively involved in politics, leading to his membership of the Scottish Green Party.[4]
Early parliamentary career[edit]
Initial campaigns[edit]
Harvie addresses rally outside Scottish Parliament, 2009Harvie was elected as MSP for the Glasgow region at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election. He gained attention both for issues strongly associated with the Greens, such as campaigning against the extension to the M74 motorway in Glasgow and for more 'mainstream' issues such as opposition to the Identity Cards Bill.[5][6] He also supported campaigners concerned about the health impacts of tasers.[7]Quickly after becoming an MSP he caused some controversy by proposing civil partnership legislation in the Scottish Parliament.[8] Though this legislation was ultimately handled at Westminster and covered the whole UK, the distinctive Scottish proposals helped to stimulate some public debate north of the border, both on the issue of same-sex relationships and on the process known as a Legislative Consent Motion by which the Scottish Parliament allows Westminster to legislate for the whole UK. When civil partnerships were introduced, Harvie condemned councils who enabled staff not to conduct same-sex civil partnership ceremonies.[9]
Communities Spokesperson[edit]
Harvie was a member of the Communities Committee of the Scottish Parliament throughout the 2nd Scottish Parliament and served as Scottish Greens Spokesperson for Justice and Communities from 2003 to 2005 and Spokesperson for Justice, Communities, Europe and Constitutional Affairs from 2005 to 2007.[10] Through his work on the Communities Committee, he worked on the Anti-social behaviour Bill, the Charities Bill and the Housing Bill, as well as on issues of homelessness, debt, the planning system and building standards.
In 2004 Harvie was given the 'One to Watch' award at the annual Scottish Politician of the Year event. In addition to the Communities portfolio, Harvie covered the Justice portfolio for the Greens, and has been active on a number of civil liberties issues. He has also been convener of the Cross Party Group (CPG) on Human Rights, and helped to establish a CPG on Sexual Health.

Co-Convenor of the Scottish Greens[edit]
Co-convenorship bid[edit]
He became the male co-convenor of the Scottish Greens on 22 September 2008 after being the only person to stand for the position, after Robin Harper resigned.[11][12] He is the first openly bisexual leader of a political party in the United Kingdom.

Increasing influence[edit]
Following the Green Party's disappointing performance in the 2007 election, Harvie was returned with a reduced share of the vote. The tight parliamentary arithmetic and a constructive relationship with the Scottish National Party (SNP) led to a Co-operation Agreement between the two parties. Under this, Harvie was elected to be convene the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee, an office he held until 2011.[13]Despite working closer with the SNP, he remained opposed to the Scottish Government's infrastructure projects, including his longstanding opposition to the M74 motorway and their planning framework, claiming it represented only ""more bridges, more airport expansion, and barely a thought for the major renewables projects that should be front and centre in a document like this"".[14][15] However, he was also able to secure the Scottish Government's support for legislation to tackle LGBT and disability hate crime.[16][17]
In 2015, Harvie witnessed the first same-sex wedding in Scotland, alongside Nicola Sturgeon who officiated it.[18]Harvie campaigning alongside Alison Johnstone and other Green Party members in 20142014 Independence referendum[edit]
See also: Scottish independence
Harvie is a supporter of Scottish independence and voted 'Yes' in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. In the run up to the referendum, he was part of the Yes Scotland campaign and campaigned alongside Nicola Sturgeon.[19] While he campaigned in-favour, not as a 'nationalist', Harvie stated the cause for independence was ""for a vision of Scotland as a peaceful country with social justice, equality and environmental protection at its core"".[20]
Re-election in 2016[edit]
Re-elected in 2016, Harvie joined the Finance and Constitution Committee and became Scottish Greens Spokesperson for Finance, Economy, Fair Work and Equalities.[21][22]In 2017, Harvie supported the successful North Kelvin meadow campaign to take over an area of greenspace into community ownership, as part of a wider Green push for land reform.[23]
Brexit and future referendum on independence[edit]
In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Harvie called for a 'Remain' vote. After the result, he said Scotland ""must keep open every option for protecting ourselves from this threat""[24]Since Brexit, he has voiced his support for the Scottish Government's proposal for a second independence referendum.[25] When rumours emerged that Nicola Sturgeon was considering 'shelving' another referendum, Harvie called on the Scottish Government to ""keep its promise to pass an independence bill to protect Scotland from a hard Brexit.""[26] He has argued that the 2014 independence campaign was wrong to advocate to keep the pound and publish an ""encyclopaedic White Paper, as it contained too many things for people to dislike,""[2]He also criticised Labour when led by Jeremy Corbyn, calling it ""feeble"", but nonetheless called for ""progressive forces to join together to take on the Tories"".[27]
Co-leader of the Scottish Greens[edit]
After changes to their constitution, Harvie was elected co-leader of Scottish Greens alongside Lorna Slater in a 2019 co-leadership election.[28]With Slater, Harvie led their party into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and won nine seats, the most Greens ever elected to the Scottish Parliament.[29]
Bute House Agreement[edit]
Agreement at Bute House in 2021In August 2021 after weeks of talks, he was at Bute House with his co-leader Lorna Slater and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to announce a power-sharing agreement that would see the Green party in government for the first time in the United Kingdom. There was no agreement on oil and gas exploration, but the government now argued that it had a stronger case for a national independence referendum and pledged to hold an independence referendum before the end of 2023 if the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.[30] As part of the agreement the Green Party would have two ministers in government.[31]
Visiting the Seven Lochs project in Easterhouse, Glasgow, to announce a multi-year funding commitment for the Nature Restoration Fund, November 2021Junior minister; 2021 to present[edit]
On 30 August 2021, Harvie was appointed Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings, Active Travel and Tenants' Rights.[32] He and Slater are the first Green Party politicians in both Scottish and UK political history to serve in government.
In April 2023, Harvie was the subject of criticism after Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine claimed she felt bullied by him.[33]As part of the Scottish budget process in 2023, he attended emergency Cabinet meetings as part of efforts to finalize the Scottish budget and secure agreement between his party and the SNP.[34]
COP26[edit]
During his tenure, COP26 was held in his home city of Glasgow and Harvie used to occasion to raise the issue of Scottish independence with world leaders.[35] He also got into a dispute with Greenpeace, which had recently criticised Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon had asked the British Government whether the new Cambo oil field near Shetland should be ""reassessed"" in light of the climate crisis. However, Greenpeace said fence sitting was not good enough and urged the First Minister to ""stop hiding behind Boris Johnson"" and oppose the oilfield.[36] Harvie said the organisation did not understand Scottish politics and the SNP's attachment to the oil industry. ""I do think that we are more actively plugged into the Scottish political agenda than Greenpeace,"" Harvie told journalists. ""And I do think Greenpeace, understandably, look at issues such as Cambo in a UK context and don't see it in a Scottish Parliament context.”[37]
Tenants protections[edit]
Harvie consulted on a 'New Deal for Tenants' in 2021, which would include rent controls, a right to have a pet and eviction protections.[38]In October 2022, Harvie introduced the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 to freeze rents and ban evictions in response to the cost of living crisis.[39] The emergency legislation was the first bill to be introduced by a Green minister in the UK. The next year, Harvie extended the legislation, but removed the rent freeze in favour of a rent cap.[40] His measures faced legal challenges by landlords who claimed that the measures breached the European Convention on Human Rights.[41]
Patrick Harvie visits a housing development using heat pumps, 2023The measures were extended for a final time in September 2023, with Harvie promising the introduction of permanent rent controls.[42][43] In October 2023, Harvie began to consult on what these may look like.[44]
Zero Carbon Buildings[edit]
In November 2023 Harvie consulted on proposals to require homeowners and businesses to change how homes are heated.[45] He also confirmed that all homes will have to meet energy efficiency standards by 2033 and that all homes would need to replace gas boilers by 2045.[46] The former proposal was criticised as creating a ""ten-year timebomb"" by the Scottish Conservatives.

Political views[edit]
Scottish republicanism[edit]
See also: Scottish republicanism
As well as a supporter of Scottish independence, Harvie supports an independent Scottish republic. He has been highly critical of the British monarchy, calling for the monarch to be replaced with a ""democratically accountable head of state"", as well as describing the Royal Family an ""outdated, discredited and totally undemocratic institution"".[19]
Personal life[edit]
Harvie is bisexual, and in 2003 became the first openly bisexual Member of the Scottish Parliament.[47] He is an advocate of Open Source and Free Software, and is a Linux user.[citation needed] His use of Twitter during an important political dinner drew much media comment.[48]Harvie was formerly an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society,[49] Honorary Vice-President of the Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association and a patron of Parents Enquiry Scotland. He was a board member of the former Glasgay! Festival, and is a member of Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Equality Network, Stonewall (UK), Amnesty International, Humanist Society Scotland, Campaign for Real Ale and the Campaign Against the Arms Trade. From 2003 until 2007, Harvie wrote a weekly column in the Scottish edition of the Big Issue.
Harvie was a candidate in the election for Rector of the University of Glasgow in February 2008.[50]

A member of the Scottish Labour and Co-operative Party, he currently serves as Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow region in the 6th Scottish Parliament, elected in May 2021. He previously served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow North East in the 57th Parliament of the United Kingdom, from 2017 to 2019.
Sweeney studied at the University of Stirling and University of Glasgow before working in shipbuilding and serving in the British Armed Forces within the Army Reserve. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Glasgow North East at the 2017 general election, after which he was appointed Shadow Minister for Scotland.
Sweeney lost his seat at the 2019 general election but was selected as a candidate on the Glasgow regional list for the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and was initially appointed as Shadow Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation during the election campaign in March 2021, later being appointed as Shadow Minister for Employment and Public Finance after the election in May 2021.[1] He was appointed as Shadow Minister for Mental Health in January 2023.[2]
Early life and education[edit]
Sweeney was born at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow on 16 January 1989 to Anne Patricia Sweeney (née Doherty), a bank clerk and John Gordon Sweeney, a shipyard worker.[3] The elder of two brothers,[4] he was brought up in Auchinairn, and Milton.[5] Sweeney attended St. Matthew's Primary School and Turnbull High School in Bishopbriggs.
The first and only member of his family to attend university, Sweeney studied at the University of Stirling, gaining a Certificate of Higher Education with Distinction in Economics and Political Science, before continuing his degree at the University of Glasgow, where he graduated with a first class MA (Hons) in Economic History and Political Science in 2011, achieving the prize for best joint honours performance in Economic History, including a research project on the post-war economic development of Yarrow Shipbuilders, the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company and Upper Clyde Shipbuilders.[6][7][8] At university he also became involved in debating with the Glasgow University Dialectic Society, of which he is an honorary life member.[9] He served as a trustee on the Glasgow University Union's board of management from 2013 to 2020.[10]
Early career[edit]
At the age of seventeen, Sweeney joined the Army Reserve, initially serving in the Royal Corps of Signals with 32 Signal Regiment, before transferring to 52nd Lowland, 6th Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland at Walcheren Barracks.[11]After undertaking an internship with BAE Systems at Portsmouth Naval Base as an undergraduate, Sweeney joined the company's graduate development programme with BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships in 2011,[12] based at the Govan and Scotstoun shipyards on the Clyde, where he undertook a series of roles in production engineering and shipbuilding operations management on the Type 45 destroyer, Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier and Type 26 frigate programmes, including co-authoring a 2014 publication on the construction programme for the Type 45 destroyer.[13][14] Whilst at BAE Systems, Sweeney also initiated a project with the Glasgow School of Art's Digital Design Studio to introduce virtual reality methods into complex naval ship design and construction.[15][16]At the end of 2015, Sweeney joined the national economic development agency Scottish Enterprise as a senior executive, working with the leadership of companies across the defence, marine, shipbuilding, aerospace and engineering sectors based in Scotland.[17] In April 2016, he was elected as a Council Member and Fellow of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland (IESIS).[18]
Political activism[edit]
Sweeney joined the Labour Party and Co-operative Party in 2008[19] and first became an active campaigner during the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election, after receiving a telephone call from Sarah Brown encouraging him to get involved.[5]While working in the shipyards he joined the Unite and GMB trade unions, later joining PCS whilst at Scottish Enterprise.[20] He is also on the executive committee of the Scottish Fabian Society and a member of Open Labour, Momentum and Campaign for Socialism. Sweeney came to prominence during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, after he organised an open letter signed by young shipyard workers opposing the break-up of the UK, and subsequently spoke at a rally alongside Gordon Brown on the eve of the referendum.[21][22][23][24]Sweeney's first experience of standing as an election candidate was in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, where he placed twelfth on the Scottish Labour Party's regional list for West Scotland.[25]
Parliamentary career[edit]
2017 election[edit]
At the 2017 general election he stood for Glasgow North East where a 12% swing to Labour led to him defeating Anne McLaughlin of the SNP by just 242 votes, overturning a 25% majority of 9,222 in an unexpected result, having not even prepared a victory speech.[26][27] McLaughlin had taken the seat from the previous MP, William Bain of the Labour Party at the 2015 general election, and she had been elected with a 39% swing; which was the largest swing at the 2015 general election seen anywhere in the UK.[28] The seat and its predecessors had previously been held by Labour MPs continuously since George Hardie, brother of the Labour Party's founder Keir Hardie, was elected for Glasgow Springburn in 1935. At the age of 28, he was the second youngest Labour MP elected in 2017, after Danielle Rowley.[29]
MP for Glasgow North East[edit]
On 3 July 2017, he was appointed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as the Shadow Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.[30] He made his maiden speech to the House of Commons on 13 July 2017, during which he expressed his opposition to Conservative austerity policies that had led to a fall in living standards.[31][32] During the 2017 Scottish Labour leadership election, Sweeney endorsed Richard Leonard, who was ultimately the successful candidate, having previously worked with him to co-author Scottish Labour's industrial strategy in 2016.[33][34] In an interview with Ewen MacAskill of The Guardian shortly after his election, he described himself as being on the soft left of the party.[35] He was a critic of the seven Labour MPs who defected to form Change UK in February 2019, describing them as ""self-centred careerists"" at a meeting which took place the following month to mark the relaunch of Tribune magazine.[36]
Parliamentary expenses[edit]
In 2019, he was cited as the least expensive MP in Scotland by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, including: constituency office costs and staff salaries, as well as London accommodation rent and travel costs.[37]
2019 election[edit]
Sweeney lost his seat to the previous Scottish National Party MP Anne McLaughlin, at the 2019 general election with a marginal majority of 2,458 votes on a 4% swing, the closest result in Glasgow.[38] After losing his seat, he went on to work on Angela Rayner's successful campaign in the 2020 Labour Party deputy leadership election.[39] He later described the experience of losing his seat as, “The most spectacular sacking in recent Glasgow history. I was the only scalp in Glasgow that night. It was a fairly unpleasant experience. It's almost like a public execution. It's got a grim voyeurism to it. It's one of the few examples in society where people losing their jobs is treated like a blood sport.”[40]
2021 Scottish Parliament election[edit]
On the one year anniversary of his defeat, Sweeney announced that he intended to stand as a Labour Party list candidate for the Glasgow region in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.[41] In February 2021, it was announced by LabourList that he had placed third on Scottish Labour's regional list for Glasgow, with the second highest number of votes cast by party members in the ballot, after Anas Sarwar. The regional list rankings are alternated by gender according to the party's positive action policy.[42] After winning the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election, Sarwar appointed Sweeney as Shadow Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation.[43] Sweeney was elected as an MSP for the Glasgow region in the 6th Scottish Parliament on 8 May 2021.

MSP for Glasgow[edit]
On 13 May 2021, Sweeney took an oath of allegiance confirming his place in the Scottish Parliament as MSP for the Glasgow region.[44][45] He was appointed as Shadow Minister for Employment and Public Finance on 31 May 2021.[1] He also served as member of the Scottish Parliament's Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee[46] and Public Petitions Committee.[47] In January 2023, he was appointed as Labour's Shadow Minister for Mental Health and joined the Health, Social Care and Sport Committee, becoming deputy convener in April 2023. In September 2022, he began writing a regular fortnightly column in the Glasgow Times.[48]
Political views and campaigns[edit]
Social security[edit]
Paul Sweeney's initial campaigns in Parliament included opposition to the closure and merger of seven Jobcentre Plus sites in Glasgow by the Department for Work and Pensions and challenging cuts to social security benefits for those with disabilities during the transition from the Disability Living Allowance to the Personal Independence Payment.[49][50] He also campaigned for justice on behalf of hundreds of local residents in Balornock impacted by mis-selling of The Green Deal home energy improvement scheme.[51][52]Facing unemployment and no income during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweeney revealed he had begun applying for Universal Credit in May 2020,[39] saying ""The reality is, the majority of Scots are working class – if they stopped earning a salary, within two months they'd be in financial difficulties. However prestigious or seemingly privileged you are in terms of your work or identity, you're never far away from that. If more of us realised how close we are to that peril, maybe the social security system wouldn't be so punitive.""[53] He later wrote an article describing his experiences of life on social security in December 2020, stating ""I will admit that I’ve occasionally had suicidal thoughts in my darker moments over the last few months."" He also called for Universal Credit to be converted into a Universal Basic Income system, ""A good start would be to use the simplified Universal Credit system as a universal leveller, enhancing it further to provide a guaranteed and dignified level of minimum income for all those who need it. The changes made to the system at the start of lockdown show that lives can be improved with a few lines of code added to the system to remove the onerous system of surveillance, restrictions, and sanctions.""[54]
Asylum and immigration[edit]
In November 2018, he won 'Best Scot at Westminster' in the annual Scottish Politician of the Year awards.[55] This was partly in recognition of his lobbying of the Home Secretary and Prime Minister in asylum seeker rights cases such as that of Giorgi Kakava, a ten-year-old orphan who had been threatened with deportation following the death of his mother,[56] the Kamil family who had been left without status for 18 years,[57] teenage brothers Somer and Areeb Umeed Bakhsh,[58][59] who were also supported by the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn during a visit to Possilpark in August 2018,[60] and trafficking victim Duc Nguyen.[61] Sweeney was also a leader of a campaign to prevent Home Office contractor Serco[62] evicting hundreds of asylum seekers from their accommodation across Glasgow,[63][64][65] including a call for direct action to prevent evictions, stating ""They’ve denied us the chance to raise this in Parliament by announcing this policy over recess. So without the ability to actually advocate for my constituents in Parliament, if necessary we’ll take direct action to picket and to occupy these properties to prevent evictions.""[66] He also committed Labour to ending unlimited immigration detention in prison-like facilities, including Dungavel.[67] He has supported women's asylum seeker support charity Saheliya in a dispute over their purchase of the historic former office building at the St. Rollox railway works in Springburn from Tesco.[68] Glasgow has the highest population of asylum seekers and refugees in the UK.[69]In May 2021, the Home Office arrested two men in Pollokshields leading to a mass protest surrounding the immigration enforcement van. Sweeney addressed the protest and called for Glaswegians to join the picket in support of the detained men.[70] In December 2021, he launched a campaign to extend the Scottish National Entitlement Card eligibility for free bus travel to all asylum seekers resident in Scotland, arguing that the vast majority were fleeing wars and persecution, but until their applications are determined they are not allowed to work, are subject to ""no recourse to public funds"" visa restrictions and are forced to live in ""slum-like"" accommodation, with just over £5 a day to live on.[71]
Armed forces and veterans[edit]
Sweeney voiced his concern to the Prime Minister, Theresa May about British participation in the April 2018 missile strikes against Syria, calling for an “internationally policed no-fly zone"" over Syria to stop the regime bombing its own population.[72] In the wake of a series of veteran suicides in the summer of 2018, including from his former regiment,[73] Sweeney criticised the British Army and Ministry of Defence for inadequate mental health support for former soldiers, and a lack of sufficient records to establish the scale of the problem, accusing them of ‘passing the buck’ to overstretched military charities like Combat Stress.[74][75] In 2019, he began a campaign with the Royal British Legion and Earl Haig Fund Scotland, backed by the Daily Record, calling on the UK Government to abolish immigration fees in the Immigration Act 2014 and Armed Forces immigration requirements as set out in the Immigration Act 1971, in order to allow over 6,000 personnel currently serving in the British Armed Forces from foreign and Commonwealth countries the free right to British citizenship, including the Brigade of Gurkhas.[76][77] He served on the public bill committee that successfully oversaw the passage of the Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Act 2018 into legislation. Sweeney also successfully campaigned to restore the Highland Light Infantry memorial in Kelvingrove Park after it was vandalised in February 2019.[78]Appointed as Scottish Labour's armed forces and veterans spokesman after his election as an MSP, Sweeney has been critical of the decision in the Ministry of Defence's 2021 Defence in a Competitive Age command paper to transfer the historic Royal Scots Borderers battalion from the Royal Regiment of Scotland into the new Ranger Regiment, losing its identity as a Scottish infantry unit, while cutting the size of the Black Watch battalion and also reducing the regiment's pipe bands.[79]
Urban regeneration[edit]
A long-standing campaigner on urban regeneration issues in Glasgow and supporter of a land value tax,[80] Sweeney raised concerns about the future of the city's historic buildings in the wake of the second Glasgow School of Art fire in June 2018,[81] calling for an independent public inquiry into the circumstances of the disaster,[82] whilst calling for the iconic building's full restoration, along with the neighbouring O2 ABC venue.[83][84] He has also campaigned to restore historic Charles Rennie Mackintosh villas in Balgrayhill,[85] to renovate David Hamilton's Mosesfield House in Springburn Park, where George Johnston built the first motor car in Britain,[86] and saved the historic Provan Gasometers from demolition by their owners SGN, securing a listing protection by Historic Environment Scotland on appeal.[87] He has proposed that the former St Enoch railway station clock, featured in the 1981 film Gregory's Girl, be returned to Glasgow from the Antonine Centre in Cumbernauld for installation in Queen Street railway station as part of its refurbishment.[88]Sweeney has campaigned for the compulsory purchase and demolition of the long-abandoned Talisman pub in Springburn,[89] and successfully lobbied for a grant funding scheme to restore historic shop fronts along Saracen Street in Possilpark.[90] He also objected to the proposed private redevelopment of the former Ruchill Hospital as inappropriate.[91] In October 2018, he exposed a multi-million-pound scrap metal theft scandal at disused buildings in the grounds of Stobhill Hospital,[92] later securing the commitment of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to restore and illuminate the clock tower at the site, which is a prominent local landmark.[93] In 2019 he proposed that the infamous Barlinnie Prison be saved from demolition and converted into a prison museum after it was announced that it is due to be closed by the Scottish Prison Service in 2025.[94] In the wake of an arson attack on the historic St. Simon's Church at Partick in July 2021, he called on the Archdiocese of Glasgow to restore the building rather than demolishing it,[95] and has also opposed the proposed demolition of the nearby Partick Baptist Church by the Baptist Union of Scotland.[96] In December 2021, Sweeney called on Glasgow City Council planners to create a new pedestrian and cycle embankment along a former railway line at Partick Central railway station running along the River Kelvin between the Riverside Museum and Kelvingrove Park, in a similar style to Manhattan's High Line.[97]In September 2021, after revealing major structural defects with two concrete viaducts carrying the north flank of the M8 Glasgow Inner Ring Road at Woodside, that will cost millions of pounds to repair, Sweeney wrote a letter to Patrick Harvie, Minister for Active Travel stating, ""it is my opinion the project to restore the crumbling Woodside Viaducts - an ugly concrete megastructure completed in 1971 after the mass demolition and displacement of the surrounding communities - is ill thought through and, in the year of COP 26, constitutes a colossal waste of taxpayers’ money."" He has requested that the Scottish Government consider alternative infrastructure schemes, citing international New Urbanism examples of freeway removal, such as Boston's Big Dig, Octavia Boulevard in San Francisco, the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement in Seattle, Cheonggyecheon in Seoul, Voie Georges-Pompidou in Paris and proposals for the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto.[98] A public petition to the Scottish Parliament has since been launched, campaigning for alternatives to renewing the M8 motorway through central Glasgow.[99]
Public transport infrastructure[edit]
A founding member of the ‘Get Glasgow Moving’ campaign in 2016,[100] Sweeney called for the protection of the proposed route of the Glasgow Crossrail project on the former City of Glasgow Union Railway line from encroachment by residential developers on a site east of the High Street, at Collegelands[101][102][103] and has advocated using the Glasgow City Deal to finance the delivery of the long-awaited Glasgow Airport Rail Link,[104][105] as well for Glasgow Airport itself to be brought back under the city's municipal ownership.[106] He criticised Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken for supporting a downgraded option to use a people mover system to the airport, instead of light rail that would be integrated with the main Paisley Gilmour Street railway station and the wider city region rail network.[107] The Glasgow Connectivity Commission, published in April 2019, endorsed the light rail option as part of a wider Glasgow Metro network, which was supported by Sweeney, who called for greater regional powers to deliver the project.[108] Sweeney has called for the extension of High Speed 2 north from Manchester to Glasgow, serving on the public bill committee that approved the High Speed Rail (West Midlands – Crewe) Act 2021.[49] He also campaigned against persistent bus service cuts in the city by First Glasgow, calling for the bus system to be returned to public ownership and regulation, as Strathclyde Buses was.[109][110]
Local government[edit]
Sweeney has frequently spoken out against a series of cuts to local public amenities by Glasgow City Council, including the controversial closure of the People's Palace in January 2019,[111] and supporting community-led campaigns against the closure of Whitehill Swimming Pool in Dennistoun,[112] as well as the city's six municipal golf courses.[113] He also spoke out against the closure of local bank branches,[114] post offices[115] and credit unions,[116] as well as to remove car parking charges at Glasgow Royal Infirmary for staff.[117] He supports a local tourist tax to help fund public services in Glasgow.[118] During the COVID-19 pandemic, he led calls for Glasgow City Council to abolish a 1996 by-law that bans drinking in the city's public parks and other outdoor spaces, and to license family-orientated beer gardens in the main parks to raise money for the city.[119] Sweeney also tabled a parliamentary motion in support of a Radio Clyde campaign to install safety lighting on key routes in Glasgow's parks at night, in the wake of an incident during the COP 26 summit in November 2021, when road closures for a world leaders reception at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum led to local residents being sent on lengthy detours though a darkened Kelvingrove Park.[120]
Industrial policy[edit]
In December 2018, the planned closure of the last railway engineering works in Springburn, the St. Rollox ‘Caley’ Railway Works in July 2019 was announced by its German owner Mutares,[121][122] despite the site running at a profit, with the loss of over 200 jobs. Sweeney led a campaign against the closure in concert with the Unite and RMT trade unions, lobbying both the UK and Scottish Governments to renationalise the works,[123][124] and putting forward several proposals to save the site from closure, even including a plan to commission the restoration of the Springburn-built South African Class GMAM ‘Springbok’ steam locomotive, in storage at Summerlee, Museum of Scottish Industrial Life in Coatbridge,[125][126] and raising the matter at Theresa May's final Prime Minister's Questions.[127] He joined workers at the site for a rally as the final shift walked out after 163 years, on 26 July 2019.[128] In May 2022, it was reported that an application he had made for the railway works site to be designated as listed by Historic Environment Scotland was successful, with the buildings and railway sidings awarded a category B listing.[129][130]As a GMB MP he supported local Asda workers campaigning against a forced downgrade to their employment contracts[131] and has been involved in negotiations to prevent the closure of the Tesco supermarket in Parkhead.[132] Sweeney also lobbied the Minister for Disabled People with the Community trade union to secure the protected places scheme at the Royal Strathclyde Blindcraft Industries in Springburn, saving over 100 jobs at the site in 2018.[133] In August 2017, he assisted traders affected by a major fire at the Blochairn Fruit & Fish Market, the largest wholesale market in Scotland, turning over £250 million worth of produce a year.[134]As vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Shipbuilding and Ship Repair,[135] he frequently raised matters of concern about Ministry of Defence's National Shipbuilding Strategy, co-authoring a report that was published in May 2019.[136] He called for greater investment in improvements to the Clyde's shipyard infrastructure,[137] a long-term continuous shipbuilding programme from Defence Equipment and Support,[138] condemned delays to Type 31 frigate procurement,[139] and played a leading role in the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions’ campaign that successfully secured a commitment from the Ministry of Defence that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary's planned Fleet Solid Support Ships are built in British shipyards. He has also questioned the commitment of Peel Ports to investment in the Firth of Clyde's Inchgreen Dry Dock due to their interest in Cammell Laird,[140][141][142][143] and called for a more effective Scottish Government approach to securing the future of the troubled Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow, criticising Caledonian Maritime Assets for their hostile approach to procuring ferries with the shipyard.[144]As an MSP, he has raised concerns about the Scottish Government's guarantees and loans to Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House Group, which acquired the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme and aluminium smelter in 2016, along with the Dalzell and Clydebridge Steelworks in 2017, with a potential exposure to the government of over half a billion pounds after the failure of its main financial backer, Greensill Capital in March 2021.[145] Sweeney led a debate at Holyrood in calling for the First Minister to support the campaign to save the McVitie's biscuit factory in Tollcross from closure after its Turkish owner, Pladis announced a plan to cease production at the site by the end of 2022, threatening 500 jobs.[146] He also criticised Associated British Foods in July 2021 for announcing a cut of 70 jobs out of a workforce of around 90 at their Milton bakery in the north of the city.[147]
Brexit[edit]
Sweeney campaigned for the UK to remain as a member state of the European Union during the 2016 referendum.[148] As an MP, he was a prominent supporter of the Labour campaign for a confirmatory public vote on the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, voting for that option along with staying in the Customs Union and Single Market during the Parliamentary votes on Brexit,[149] as well as supporting the continuation of freedom of movement for workers.[150] In leaked WhatsApp messages, the ""soft Brexit"" position taken by Scottish Labour in its 2019 European Parliament election campaign was criticised by Sweeney, who wrote, ""If it's like this then it's a bad misjudgement and I'm having nothing to do with it... Let's hope the NEC [National Executive Committee] kill this bullshit line.""[151] Scottish Labour lost both its seats, receiving 9.3% of the vote and coming fifth behind the SNP, Brexit Party, Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Conservatives respectively.[152] In the aftermath, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard accepted responsibility and said he would endorse remaining in the European Union.[153]He was also one of 78 Parliamentarians who challenged the five-week prorogation of Parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the Court of Session. The case, together with a case brought in England and Wales by Gina Miller, was ultimately successful in the Supreme Court, resulting in the quashing of the prorogation on 24 September 2019.[154]
UK constitutional reform[edit]
Although not in favour of Scottish independence, Sweeney has consistently called for major reform to make the UK a federal state,[155] including greater self-government for the Greater Glasgow city region,[156] replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate, and electoral reform to introduce proportional representation to replace the first-past-the-post voting system for the House of Commons as a member of the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform.[157][158] He has suggested that any future independence referendum should not be a binary vote as in 2014, but instead take the form of a multi-option referendum.[159]
Education reform[edit]
Sweeney has called for all private schools in Scotland to be stripped of their charitable status and integrated with the state sector, saying in 2019: “Not only should these private businesses catering to elitist attitudes towards education not be the privileged beneficiaries of tax breaks for perfunctory charity work, but all private schools should be brought, en masse, into the state sector. We should take the grubby pound sign out of British education altogether and open it up to everyone to have access because at the moment it is not available to 93% of people.”[160] The policy of private school integration was later adopted at the 2019 Labour Party Conference.[161]
Drug reform[edit]
A supporter of drug policy reform whilst an MP,[162] in March 2020 Sweeney announced that he was supporting activist Peter Krykant in his efforts to open an unsanctioned supervised overdose prevention site in Glasgow in an effort to persuade the Lord Advocate and Scottish Government to introduce a legal framework to regulate their official operation, in a similar manner to needle and syringe programmes, by demonstrating that the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 does not make it illegal to allow someone to consume controlled drugs on a premises.[163] It started operating in September 2020.[164][165] Scottish Labour has since adopted a policy in favour of drug decriminalisation.[166][167] In May 2022, Mr Sweeney launched a consultation on his proposed private member's bill, the Drugs Death Prevention (Scotland) Bill, in response to drug related deaths in Scotland. This bill would create a licensing framework to enable the establishment of Overdose Prevention Centres following the unsanctioned supervised drug consumption pilot run by Peter Krykant in Glasgow [168][169] In November 2022, he won 'Community MSP of the Year' at The Herald's Scottish Politician of the Year awards for his work on the drugs death crisis, including a bill to establish overdose prevention centres.[170]
Coronavirus pandemic[edit]
In May 2021, amid a spike in COVID-19 cases, Sweeney raised the idea of partitioning levels of public health restrictions within Glasgow, using the River Clyde as a boundary between the north and south of the city.[171]
Belt and Road Initiative[edit]
Sweeney is a critic of the Belt and Road Initiative, describing it as having an ""ulterior motive"" of ""recycling chronic domestic Chinese trade surpluses into an external loan sharking scheme, creating a sphere of debt-fuelled dependence and influence across the global south."" after China took ownership of Entebbe International Airport from Uganda after they defaulted on loans from the scheme to expand the airport.[172]
Outside politics[edit]
Sweeney has an interest in built heritage and architectural issues in Glasgow.[173] He is a director of the Glasgow City Heritage Trust, a member of Glasgow Building Preservation Trust[174] and has led walks as part of Glasgow Doors Open Days Festival for several years.[175] Sweeney was also involved in the restoration of the historic former Govan shipyard head offices into the Fairfield Heritage Centre in 2014, for which he won an award, and the restoration of the 'Light and Life' sculpture on the former headquarters building of the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society in the Kingston district of Glasgow in 2016.[176][177] In 2021, he became a trustee of The Egyptian Halls SCIO, a Scottish Civic Trust project to save the Alexander 'Greek' Thomson masterpiece.[178][179]After campaigning against the demolition of Springburn Public Halls in 2012,[180] he founded the Springburn Winter Gardens Trust, which is working to restore the nearby historic glasshouse in Springburn Park.[181] An £8 million restoration programme by Collective Architecture to convert the building into a major events and performance venue was unveiled by the Trust in October 2020.[182]In February 2019, the Daily Record reported that an unnamed Scottish MP had made a formal complaint that Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson had groped them in Strangers' Bar in October 2018, in the wake of a similar incident that was alleged to have occurred earlier that month.[183] The Daily Mail named Sweeney as the complainant in November 2019, leading to the chairman of Thomson's local Conservative Association refusing to sign the nomination papers to allow him to stand as a Conservative candidate for Aberdeen South in the December 2019 general election.[184] Thomson's former civil partner also came forward to cite similar instances of behaviour.[185]The Times reported in February 2020 that the investigation had been widened to include a further allegation of a similar nature.[186] In July 2020, Sweeney branded the investigation process ""shambolic"" and ""not fit for purpose"".[187] In October 2020, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards ruled that the allegation of sexual assault was not upheld by the available evidence. The Commissioner found there was evidence Thomson put his arms around Sweeney and inappropriately invaded his personal space while drunk but ruled there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that this behaviour was sexual in nature.[41] It has since been reported that Sweeney is appealing the ruling.[188]

In the 1999–2003 Parliament, she served as vice-chair of the Scottish Parliament Labour Group.
McNeill was re-elected as an MSP in 2003 and was appointed convener of the Justice Committee. She led parliamentary consideration of:

Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003
Civil Partnership Act 2004
Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Bill
Scottish Criminal Record Office Inquiry
Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006
Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006McNeill's committee also led consideration of reforms to the High Court amongst many other subjects and convened the first ever inquiry into the Crown and Procurator Fiscal Service, and helped deliver justice for asbestos victims in the Court of Session. In 2005, she was awarded the Equality Network's Friend for Life award for her work on the committee ensuring the Civil Partnership Act 2004 and Gender Recognition Act 2004 legislation passed at the British Government level were compliant with existing Scottish legislation. Later, her committee won Committee of the Year at the 2006 Scottish Politician of the Year Awards.
McNeill, a former band manager, was convener of the Cross Party Group on Contemporary Music. The group worked with key figures in the Scottish live music industry to launch the Scottish Live Music Manifesto and publish a Live Music Code of Conduct and Live Music Agreement, to improve protection for bands and young musicians from unscrupulous venues, agents and promoters.
McNeill was a staunch opponent of the Iraq War[1] and campaigned for the right of protesters to picket the 2003 Scottish Labour Party Conference, which took place at the SECC in her own constituency.

As Convener of the Cross Party Group on Palestine, she was a United Nations observer at the 2006 Palestinian legislative election. Later in 2006, she visited Lebanon in the aftermath of the war there.
In 2007, McNeill narrowly retained the Glasgow Kelvin seat with a reduced majority in the wake of public opposition to the national Labour government's invasion of Iraq, a policy she opposed. Following the election, she was appointed Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Children and Early Years and subsequently Spokesperson for Europe, External Affairs and Culture.
McNeill lost Glasgow Kelvin in 2011 but was elected on the Glasgow regional list in 2016. She is currently the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Justice.[2] In addition to this, she is Deputy Convenor of the Social Security Committee, a new committee created in response to the increase in devolved powers given by the Scotland Act 2016. She is also a substitute member for the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee and the Local Government and Communities Committee.
McNeill nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[3]

On the environment, she has campaigned for more effective steps to increase recycling take-up and reduce energy usage.
On transport and planning, McNeill has called for better regulation of the bus industry, improvements to the Glasgow Subway, a more locally accountable planning system and improving local sports facilities. She has supported successful campaigns to grant Fair Trade status to the City of Glasgow and restore the Kelvingrove Park bandstand.

McNeill unsuccessfully campaigned against the downgrading of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill and the Queen Mother's Hospital, including raising a 1,600-signature petition. However, children's services at what became West Glasgow Ambulatory Care Hospital closed in 2015 and their responsibilities were taken up by the Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow.[4]
Political positions and views[edit]
Since her student days, McNeill has had a strong interest in defence and foreign policy issues. She opposes the replacement of Trident with a new nuclear weapons system, opposes the holding of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay[5] and has spoken out in favour of the rights of asylum seekers and new migrants. She continues to speak out, both in parliament and at public demonstrations, on the need for Middle East peace.[6]McNeill remains a supporter of many student campaigns, including the successful campaign to elect Israeli dissident Mordechai Vanunu as Rector of Glasgow University and takes a keen interest in the welfare of students across the many further and higher institutions located in Glasgow.

He served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the North East Scotland region between 2016 and 2021. In the Scottish Parliament, he was the Conservative spokesperson for rural economy and connectivity, until May 2018 when he resigned over a lobbying row.

Personal detailsBorn (1963-06-26) 26 June 1963 (age 60)Stornoway, Outer Hebrides, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Labour Co-operativeAlma materOpen UniversityWebsiteOfficial WebsiteRhoda Grant (born 26 June 1963) is a Scottish politician who has served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Highlands and Islands region since 2007, having previously represented the same region from 1999 to 2003. A member of the Scottish Labour and Co-operative Party, She is currently the Shadow Cabinet Secretary Minister for Land Reform, Islands and Chief Whip.[1]
Early life and career[edit]

Political career[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 2011In the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, Grant was elected to a list seat for the Highlands and Islands region.[2] In the 2003 election, she fought the Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber constituency but came second to Fergus Ewing of the Scottish National Party, who held the seat by 1,000 votes. In that election, she also lost her regional list seat.
In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Grant was again elected as a regional list MSP for Highlands and Islands,[3] as the Scottish Green Party's vote share collapsed and Labour won three list seats, and she was re-elected in the 2011 election.
In 2013, Grant campaigned for filters to be put in place to make the viewing or downloading of internet pornography more difficult, arguing there had been a significant connection between pornography, the sex industry, abuse and violence against women.[4]Grant was appointed Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Women and Equality by new leader Richard Leonard on 19 November 2017, and was also its parliamentary business manager between 19 November 2017 and 4 October 2018, when she was succeeded by Neil Findlay.[5][6] She became Spokesperson for Finance on 2 September 2019.[7] She served as Spokesperson for Eradication of Poverty and Inequality from April to November 2020[8] and Spokesperson for Justice from November 2020 to March 2021.[9]Grant defended Richard Leonard after calls for him to resign in September 2020, saying:

The crisis facing our country requires bold thinking and it requires a united Scottish Labour Party, under the leadership of Richard Leonard, fighting for the real change we need.[10]Grant nominated Monica Lennon in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[11]Personal life[edit]
Grant is married and has a sister whom she cat-sits for.[12]

Born and raised in Yorkshire, Leonard won a scholarship to be educated at Pocklington School. He moved to Scotland in the 1980s to study Politics and Economics at the University of Stirling. Following his graduation, he worked as an aide to Labour politician Alex Falconer before working as a trade unionist for the Scottish Trades Union Congress and GMB Scotland. From 2002 to 2003, he served as Chair of the Scottish Labour Party when he was active in opposing the Iraq War. After unsuccessfully contesting Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley in 2011, he was elected at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election on the Central Scotland regional list.
Leonard defeated Anas Sarwar to win the 2017 Scottish Labour leadership election, succeeding Kezia Dugdale, and he later took on the role of Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work. After replacing Jackie Baillie in a 2018 frontbench reshuffle, Baillie was elected as his new deputy leader in 2020. A supporter of Jeremy Corbyn,[1] Leonard was credited for shifting Scottish Labour leftwards but criticised for poor results in the 2019 European Parliament election and 2019 general election. He faced a motion of no confidence in his leadership put forward by members of the political right of the party[citation needed]  but the motion failed to gain enough support.[2] He remained as leader until standing down in January 2021 prior to the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.

Early life and career[edit]
Leonard was born in January 1962 in Westow, East Riding of Yorkshire and raised in the market town of Malton, North Yorkshire.[3][4][5][6] He is the son of Derek, a tailor and member of the Tailor and Garment Workers Union, and Janet, who looked after him and his two sisters.[7] From the age of 11, he was educated at the independent, fee-paying Pocklington School in the East Riding of Yorkshire, having received a local education authority scholarship.[6][8] As a young boy, his first job was picking potatoes in Autumn.[5] He was inspired politically in his youth by Arguments for Socialism written by Tony Benn, a leftist Labour Member of Parliament and former cabinet minister.[3] He was further influenced by Farewell to the Working Class and Critique of Economic Reason by Austrian philosopher André Gorz, as well as the works of early socialist novelist William Morris.[9]Leonard studied Politics and Economics at the University of Stirling, where he was a member of the Labour club and president of the Students' Association.[10] He was a contemporary of future First Minister of Scotland Jack McConnell and they shared a flat together for a time following graduation.[7] While a student, he had a summer job weeding wheat fields in Suffolk, East Anglia, after his family moved south to help his father find work.[5] After university, he went on to spend five years working as an aide to Alex Falconer, Member of the European Parliament for Mid Scotland and Fife.[10][11] He then spent a further five years as head of economics and assistant secretary for the Scottish Trades Union Congress.[11] He then worked for 20 years as a GMB Scotland industrial organiser, a role in which he represented women, apprentices and young people on low pay.[12][11]
Early political career[edit]
Throughout Leonard's working life, he was active in the Scottish Labour Party, including serving as election agent for Anne McGuire in Stirling at the 1997 general election where they unseated Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Forsyth by 6,411 votes. Leonard served as Chair of the Scottish Labour Party from 2002 to 2003 but opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, marching against the war and describing the bombing of Baghdad as ""awful"".[3][13]Leonard stood as the Labour candidate for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election but lost to the Scottish National Party's Adam Ingram.[14] At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, he contested Airdrie and Shotts. The SNP's Alex Neil held the seat but Leonard was elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament as one of seven additional members for the Central Scotland region.[15][16] Shortly after his election as an MSP, he was given a junior role on the Scottish Labour frontbench as Shadow Economy Minister by leader Kezia Dugdale.[17] He supported Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 UK Labour Party leadership election.[18]
Leader of the Scottish Labour Party[edit]
2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election[edit]
The 2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election was triggered by the sudden resignation of Kezia Dugdale in August. During the campaign to decide her successor, BBC News described Leonard as more left-wing than his rival, Anas Sarwar.[19] Leonard received celebrity endorsement from cult comic book scribe Mark Millar, known for Kick-Ass and Kingsman, who said he was ""the most exciting thing to happen up here in decades"".[20] On 18 November 2017, it was announced he had been elected as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, receiving 56.7% of the vote on a 62.3% turnout.[21][22]Only a few hours after the leadership election result was declared, Kezia Dugdale announced she was set to join reality TV game show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. This would mean she would be in Australia for several weeks while the Scottish Parliament was still in session. Leonard said he would discuss with Labour MSPs whether she would be suspended for failing to notify the party.[23] It was decided she would not be suspended but, instead, sent a written warning from Scottish Labour Parliamentary Business Manager James Kelly. When she returned from Australia, she met with Leonard and other colleagues and released a statement expressing regret at her announcement overshadowing Leonard's victory. She also donated the earnings from her MSP's salary while absent, as well as part of the money earned from the show, to charity.[24]
Early leadership: 2017–2019[edit]
Leonard was an ally of Labour leader Jeremy CorbynIn December 2017, Leonard announced his new Shadow Cabinet. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour's longest-serving constituency MSP, was appointed as Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work. Leonard's former leadership rival Anas Sarwar was kept as Shadow Health and Sport Secretary. Neil Findlay, a close ally of both Leonard and Jeremy Corbyn, was made Shadow Brexit and Constitutional Relations Secretary.[25] The announcement of Elaine Smith as a shadow inequality minister was controversial. A practising Roman Catholic, she had a record of opposing same-sex marriage, likening it to polygamy in 2013. Leonard said he disagreed with her position on same-sex marriage but felt her criticisms of wealth disparity justified her appointment.[26]Leonard somewhat distanced himself from Jeremy Corbyn in 2017, saying ""I'm too long in the tooth to be a Corbynista"".[27] However, in his 2018 Labour Party Conference speech, he ""confessed"" to voting for Corbyn to be leader both in 2015 and 2016 because he believed Scotland would need a radical Corbyn government.[28] Under his leadership, Scottish Labour would also go on to adopt the ""For the Many, Not the Few"" branding of the UK Labour Party.[29]President of the United States Donald Trump, whose mother was Scottish, travelled to Scotland during his July 2018 UK state visit. Leonard attended protests in Glasgow and outside the Scottish Parliament opposing the visit because of Trump's attitudes and actions towards women, ethnic minorities and the poor.[30] Trump returned to Scotland while on a June 2019 royal visit and Leonard spoke at a protest rally outside St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh.[31]In September 2018, Scottish Labour cut funding for Kezia Dugdale's defence in a defamation case by video games journalist and nationalist blogger Stuart Campbell.[32] They had previously promised not to do so and there was controversy over whether the decision was encouraged by the UK party.[33] Dugdale subsequently won the case on the grounds of principle of fair comment.[34] In leaked messages, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray wrote, ""Ultimately she won her case and the party lost £80,000 as they would've got their costs had they kept their promise."" He also wrote the decision was the ""final straw"" which caused her to leave Holyrood in 2019 and he angrily derided the Scottish Labour leadership as ""full of thugs and incompetents"".[35]Leonard carried out a frontbench reshuffle in October 2018, following a series of negative briefings by MSPs close to Kezia Dugdale.[36] He took on the role of Shadow Economy Secretary, dismissing Jackie Baillie. Anas Sarwar was replaced by Monica Lennon, who was succeeded as Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary by Alex Rowley. Both Lennon and Rowley had been allies of Leonard, and ally Neil Findlay was given the added role of Parliamentary Business Manager.[37] Critics of Leonard briefed the reshuffle was a purge of moderate MSPs. They also criticised how Baillie and Sarwar found out about their dismissals; Baillie by phone five minutes before it was publicly announced and Sarwar over Twitter while attending a Holyrood chamber debate. Leonard said the reshuffle was necessary to refresh his frontbench and ensure unity among its members.[38] Former government minister Hugh Henry defended Leonard, arguing Baillie and Sarwar had both been disloyal.[39]Following the resignation of Kezia Dugdale from the Scottish Parliament in 2019, former MSP and Transport Minister Sarah Boyack took her place on the Lothian regional list. In the September, Leonard appointed her Shadow Local Government Secretary. He moved Alex Rowley to cover Brexit and constitutional relations and moved Shadow Finance Secretary James Kelly to cover justice. He also brought on North Ayrshire Council leader Joe Cullinane as head of campaigns and party engagement. Leonard said the additions would strengthen his core team but admitted Scottish Labour would still ""need to make a strong case"" to win back voters.[40]In April 2019, Anas Sarwar's case against Rutherglen councillor Davie McLachlan, who allegedly said ""Scotland wouldn't vote for a brown Muslim Paki"", was dropped by the National Constitutional Committee on a technicality. In public support of Sarwar, Leonard said, ""We have doubled the size of the National Constitutional Committee which hears these cases but, as this case shows, clearly more still needs to be done"".[41]At the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell insisted a Labour government would not block the holding of a second Scottish independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament voted for one. These remarks met with opposition from Leonard and other Scottish Labour colleagues.[42][43] This caused Jeremy Corbyn to issue a statement that a Scottish Parliament vote could not be the only requirement for a new mandate, other requirements had yet to be met and, if they were met, a referendum would still not be priority for an incoming government. Both Leonard and McDonnell accepted Corbyn's decision on the matter, which was a compromise between their two positions.[44]
2019 European Parliament election and aftermath: April–September 2019[edit]
Leonard led Scottish Labour into the 2019 European Parliament election with the party inheriting, from 2014, two of the six seats in Scotland.[45]David Martin, an MEP since 1984, was first on the party list and former MSP Jayne Baxter succeeded Catherine Stihler as second.[46] The campaign was managed by Neil Findlay.[47] Scottish Labour vowed to pursue a ""soft Brexit"", consistent with the UK party.[48] This was heavily challenged by the overtly pro-Remain SNP, as well as an insurgent Brexit Party.[49] Brexit compounded an issue already facing Scottish Labour in the wake of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum; its loss of nationalist support to the SNP and unionist support to the Scottish Conservatives.[49]In leaked WhatsApp messages, the ""soft Brexit"" position taken by Leonard's campaign was criticised by Shadow Minister for Scotland Paul Sweeney, who wrote, ""If it's like this then it's a bad misjudgement and I'm having nothing to do with it... Let's hope the NEC [National Executive Committee] kill this bullshit line."" Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP Ged Killen wrote that the stance had given the SNP ""a new lease of life"" and East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield added that Labour was at risk of being ""dead in Scotland"".[50] Only Jeremy Corbyn's face was placed on the cover of the Scottish Labour campaign leaflet, which Leonard later admitted was a mistake and a missed opportunity to promote himself as more than Corbyn's ""man in Scotland"".[48]The result for Scotland was declared on 27 May 2019. Scottish Labour lost both its seats, receiving 9.3% of the vote and coming fifth behind the SNP, Brexit Party, Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Conservatives respectively.[51] In the aftermath, Leonard accepted responsibility and said he would endorse remaining in the European Union, defying the UK party.[48][47] Findlay resigned from his frontbench portfolios and promised to resign as an MSP at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. Shadow Justice Secretary Daniel Johnson also resigned, citing the election result and a lack of clarity on Brexit from Leonard.[47]In September, Leonard moved Alex Rowley to cover Brexit and constitutional relations and moved Shadow Finance Secretary James Kelly to replace Daniel Johnson as Shadow Justice Secretary. He also brought on North Ayrshire Council leader Joe Cullinane as head of campaigns and party engagement. Following Kezia Dugdale's resignation from the Scottish Parliament, former MSP and Transport Minister Sarah Boyack took Dugdale's place on the Lothian regional list and Leonard appointed her as Shadow Local Government Secretary. Leonard said the additions would strengthen his core team but admitted Scottish Labour would still ""need to make a strong case"" to win back voters.[40]
2019 general election: November–December 2019[edit]
During the 2019 general election, Leonard led the Labour campaign in Scotland. Campaign for Socialism member Lesley Brennan served as his chief of staff, former Morning Star editor Conrad Landin as director of communications and Joe Cullinane as head of campaigns and party engagement.[52][53] The core campaign pledge made by Leonard and Jeremy Corbyn was to invest an extra £70 billion in Scottish public services.[54][55] On a two-day trip to Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn was heckled in Glasgow on the first day and Dundee on the second day. In Glasgow, by a church minister over Corbyn's connections to Islamist terrorists. In Dundee, by a Scottish nationalist. The Church of Scotland later suspended the minister for historic Islamophobic and homophobic social media posts.[56][57]Scottish Labour saw itself lose the six seats it had gained in the 2017 general election, under Kezia Dugdale. Once again, the party was reduced to holding a single seat. Leonard apologised for the UK party failing to address concerns over Brexit and for the Scottish party not having stopped what he described as the ""SNP juggernaut"".[58] However, he said he would continue as leader and carry out a listening exercise.[59][60]
Election of Jackie Baillie as deputy leader and resignation: 2020–2021[edit]
@media screen and (max-width:640px){}

I think we need to see some new blood in here. One of the things the last few days have taught me is we need to see an injection of new voices, a more diverse profile of people.


Leonard on his internal Scottish Parliament critics[61]


When Leonard's deputy Lesley Laird lost her seat at the 2019 general election, she resigned from the deputy leadership shortly afterwards. Jackie Baillie then stood in the deputy leadership election to replace Laird and was elected in April 2020, having been critical of the strategy which resulted in the poor general election result.[62][63]After Baillie won the deputy leadership, Scottish Labour peer George Foulkes called on Leonard to resign and be replaced by Baillie.[64] Foulkes was joined by James Kelly, Daniel Johnson, Jenny Marra, Mark Griffin and Rachel Reeves.[65][66][67] Leonard accused his critics of never supporting his leadership and mounting ""an internal war"".[65] He also suggested MSPs could face deselection for showing disloyalty, said attempts to oust him as leader were an ""act of sabotage"" and confirmed he would fight any challenger for the leadership.[61][68][69][70] In an interview with Sky News, Leonard continued to emphasise his mandate from Scottish Labour members and that there had been five Scottish Labour leaders in the previous six years.[71][72] Kelly and other rebels put forward a motion of no confidence in Leonard's leadership. However, the motion was withdrawn after failing to gain enough support.[73] Leonard later replaced Kelly as Shadow Justice Secretary with Rhoda Grant.[74]On 14 January 2021, Leonard resigned as Scottish Labour leader with immediate effect. In a statement, he said deciding to step aside prior to the 2021 Scottish Parliament election was ""not an easy decision"" but the ""right one for me and for the party"". His Westminster counterpart, Keir Starmer insisted he was ""very proud"" of Leonard's achievements and said, ""I would like to thank Richard for his service to our party and his unwavering commitment to the values he believes in"".[75] However, according to The National, potential Labour donors allegedly told Starmer during a Zoom meeting that they would not donate to the Westminster party unless Leonard resigned.[76]
Later political career[edit]
Leonard stood as the Scottish Labour candidate in Airdrie and Shotts at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, finishing second behind Neil Gray.[77] Leonard was again returned on the Central Scotland regional list.[78]
Political positions and views[edit]
Leonard speaking at the 2018 Labour Party Conference's The World Transformed fringe eventDuring the 2019 general election campaign, Leonard described himself as a ""socialist, democrat and internationalist"".[79] He has been described by journalists as being left-wing, on the hard left and hostile to business.[80][81] His politics have been described by allies as radical, conviction-led and based around representing and helping people.[12] An ally of Jeremy Corbyn, his closeness to Corbyn was criticised as costing Scottish Labour in the polls.[82] He is a long-standing member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), which opposes the replacement of Trident with a new nuclear weapons system. However, he has stated he would defer to the position of the UK Labour Party, as defence is a non-devolved matter.[79]Leonard has said he wants to fundamentally change the Scottish economy and has advocated a shift to a more planned, long-term approach to economic management.[29] He is described in Tom Bower's biography Dangerous Hero as ""a Marxist"".[83] When questioned over this assertion in an interview with Novara Media's Ash Sarkar, Leonard said, despite having read Marx, he would not describe his politics as Marxist but rather a synthesis of ""Scottish radicalism"" and those of ""post-industrial Utopians"".[9]Leonard has stated leaving the United Kingdom would create larger problems for Scotland than the UK leaving the European Union.[84] He is an opponent of a second Scottish independence referendum and has argued the 2014 referendum, in which Scotland voted to stay by 55% to 45%, was a once in a generation event.[85] While the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave the European Union by 52% to 48% in the 2016 EU referendum, Scotland itself voted to remain by 62% to 38%. Despite this, Leonard was initially in favour of the UK Labour Party's position of pursuing a ""soft Brexit"". In the aftermath of his party's poor result in the 2019 European Parliament election, he subsequently agreed to shift his pursuit to the UK remaining in the EU.[48]A former trade unionist, Leonard argues the Scottish Government must recognise trade unions and pay a real living wage on all its public contracts.[86] He has said he would support Scotland's red meat industry by investing more in abattoirs and rural supply chains, and would aim for full employment in the Highlands and Islands.[5] He has also discussed seeing working time as a unit of currency and aiming for a managed reduction in the length of work weeks.[9] He has stated Scottish Labour has ""unfinished business"" with land reform and should replace council tax with a property and land tax to force tax burden onto those with more wealth and more land.[28][86] He advocates nationalising Scottish railways, removing Scotrail from private ownership by Abellio, and bus services, with the wider aim of making bus travel free for all.[87][88]
Personal life[edit]
Leonard lives in Paisley, Renfrewshire, and is married to Karen, an organiser for GMB Scotland, with whom he has a son and a stepdaughter.[7][89] The couple own a female Hungarian vizsla named Copper.[90] He studies socialist history as a hobby, co-founding the Keir Hardie Society and being a member of the Scottish Labour History Society and the William Morris Society.[13] He is a fan of musician Paul Weller.[91]

Personal detailsBornRichard Neilson Lochhead (1969-05-24) 24 May 1969 (age 54)Paisley, Renfrewshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySpouseFiona LochheadChildren2Alma materUniversity of StirlingOccupationOffice manager; Economic development officerWebsitewww.richardlochhead.orgRichard Neilson Lochhead (born 24 May 1969) is a Scottish politician serving as the Minister for Small Business, Trade and Innovation since 2023.[1] A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he served as the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs, Food and Environment from 2007 to 2016. Lochhead has been a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) since 1999, first representing North East Scotland electoral region from 1999 to 2006, before representing the Moray constituency since 2006.
A native of Paisley, Lochhead is a graduate of the University of Stirling, where he studied Politics. He worked as an office manager for Alex Salmond, the Leader of the SNP at the time, from 1994 to 1998, before becoming an environmental development officer for Dundee City Council. He was elected to the inaugural Scottish Parliament in 1999, where he represented North East Scotland. In a 2006 by-election, Lochhead successfully succeeded Margaret Ewing in representing the Moray constituency, following her death. In the SNP's opposition benches, he held portfolios on Environment, Energy, Fishing and Rural Affairs. Following the appointment of Salmond as First Minister of Scotland in 2007, he appointed Lochhead as the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment. He remained as the Rural Affairs Secretary under First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, but added food policy onto his portfolio. He stood down from government before the dissolution of the 4th Scottish Parliament and sat as a backbencher. In 2018, he returned to government, this time as a junior Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science, before being appointed in the new post of Minister for Just Transition, Employment and Fair Work.

Early life[edit]
Richard Neilson Lochhead was born in Paisley on  24 May 1969. He attended Williamwood High School in Clarkston and Central College of Commerce in Glasgow before he graduated in 1994 in Political Studies from the University of Stirling. He worked for the SNP leader, Alex Salmond, as his Office Manager from 1994 to 1998, before becoming an environmental development officer for Dundee City Council.[2][3] He was the SNP candidate in Gordon in the 1997 UK General Election, where he finished third. He subsequently fought the Aberdeen Central constituency in both 1999 and 2003, but came second to Lewis Macdonald each time.

Political career[edit]
SNP in opposition; 1999 to 2007[edit]
Lochhead was elected to the Scottish Parliament at the 1999 election and re-elected at the 2003 election for the North East Scotland Region. In January 2006 he was selected as the SNP candidate for Moray for the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections, following the announcement that Margaret Ewing MSP would be retiring. He beat Margaret Ewing's sister-in-law, former MP Annabelle Ewing in the selection.[4] Ewing's premature death triggered a by-election and Lochhead resigned his additional member seat in April 2006 in order to successfully contest the Moray by-election. He was elected on 28 April 2006.[5] This was the first time since the Second World War that an incumbent party had retained a by-election seat without losing votes or having their majority or share of the vote lowered.
He was convener of the European and External Relations Committee of the Scottish Parliament 11 June 2003 – 14 September 2004. In opposition he held the SNP's portfolios on Environment, Energy, Fishing and Rural Affairs in the Scottish Parliament.[6]
Rural Affairs Secretary; 2007 to 2016[edit]
After the SNP's victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, it was announced on 16 May 2007 that Lochhead would be the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Environment, taking up the position the following day.[7] The junior Ministerial position of Minister for the Environment was initially given to Michael Russell (currently held by Aileen McLeod). In May 2007, Lochhead started his tenure with promises to ""relentlessly"" pursue the Scottish fishing interests on behalf of fishermen and their communities.[8]Lochhead was re-elected at the 2011 election with a further increased majority of 10,944.  He announced his resignation as Environment Secretary, effective on 18 May 2016, as Nicola Sturgeon put together her reshuffle to appoint the second Sturgeon government.[9]
Return to government; 2018 to present[edit]
On 31 August 2018 he was announced as Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science.[10]He retained his seat at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, with an increased majority, number of votes and percentage of votes cast.[11][12] After the election, he was appointed as Minister for Just Transition, Employment and Fair Work.

Personal life[edit]
Richard Lochhead is married to Fiona, and they have two children together.[9]

Personal detailsBorn (1950-06-12) 12 June 1950 (age 73)Bothwellhaugh, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyRichard Macdonald Lyle (born 12 June 1950) is a retired Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Uddingston and Bellshill constituency from 2016 to 2021, having previously represented the Central Scotland region from 2011 to 2016.[1]Before becoming an MSP, Lyle was a North Lanarkshire councillor for 30 years.

Early life[edit]
Lyle was born in Bothwellhaugh, Lanarkshire and educated at Lawmuir School and Bellshill Academy.
He worked for the Royal Bank of Scotland before entering politics.[2]
Career[edit]
Lyle joined the SNP in 1966 and served as a local councillor on Motherwell District Council and North Lanarkshire Council for 35 years, including the Bellshill ward from 2007 to 2011.[3] At the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Lyle won election as an MSP for the Central Scotland region.[2]During a debate on same-sex marriage in Scotland in August 2011, Lyle and with his SNP colleagues Dave Thompson, John Mason and Bill Walker were widely condemned for raising a motion stating that no person or organisation should be forced to be involved or to approve of same-sex marriage.[4]Lyle was at the center of an internal party dispute within the SNP Uddingston and Bellshill branch in February 2016, during which a small minority of party members state that they would refuse to vote for him at the then upcoming Scottish Parliament election.[5] It was revealed during the lead up to the election that Lyle's Holyrood nickname is ""Salty Dick""[6] after it became public knowledge that he had once claimed the cost of a £1.80 bag of chips on expenses.[7]In February 2020, Lyle announced that he would not be seeking re-election at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. ""The 2014 referendum was amazing and seeing the huge change in the number of people supporting independence and I will continue to fly the flag for independence,"" he told The National. ""But the saddest day of my life though was when untruths about my branch, about myself and about the people I know. Being called Don Corelone hurt me and hurt my wife. I am not Don Corelone.""[8]He was also the deputy convener of the cross-party Building Bridges with Israel group; he visited Israel and the occupied territories in 2018, a trip that was valued at £2,200 and was paid for by the Israeli embassy in London. In May 2020, a motion marking the 72nd anniversary of the Nakba—the exodus of Palestinians from their homeland in 1948—was tabled by fellow SNP MSP Sandra White. The Morning Star revealed that Lyle had tried to attach an amendment to the motion in which he called the tragedy ""self-inflicted"".[9]
""20% of Israel's citizens are Arabs who chose not to flee in 1948, and who enjoy their democratic rights in Israel and contribute meaningfully to Israel society at all levels, including membership of the Knesset, with several Arabs serving as high ranking members of the Israel police and army. The conclusion can only be that the [Nakba], the Arabic word for tragedy, resulting in the 1948 Palestine refugee crisis was sadly a self-inflicted tragedy, which must, after all these years, be finally resolved by peaceful means and discussions between the parties involved.""
Nadia El-Nakla, convenor of SNP Friends of Palestine, said Lyle's remarks were ""not just a revision of history but also an insult to every Palestinian worldwide"" and called on the SNP to discipline him.[10] ""If we in Scotland can’t have a constructive dialogue and examine the arguments from both sides, what chance have the warring sides after 72 years of conflict,"" Lyle said in a statement. I implore the Palestinian and Jewish peoples to sit down and negotiate a two-state solution and end the bloodshed.""[11]On 15 November 2020, after nearly 45 years as a councillor and MSP, Lyle announced his retirement from politics in an interview with the Daily Record. ""This next year will mark 45 years as a politician. And next year I will be 71 years of age. [...] I'm proud to have served as a councillor and as a Member of the Scottish Parliament – and to have served local people for over 40 years. I have enjoyed the opportunity to help influence and shape the changes we need to see from the council's Labour administration. I always encourage everyone who tells me they wish to be a politician to get involved and to go for it. Being a politician is not an easy task, it requires sacrifice and intense scrutiny, it requires hard work like any other role, but it is incredibly rewarding to serve local people and I am proud to have had the chance to do just that.""[12]
Personal life[edit]
Lyle and his wife, Marion have two children, Vincent and Marina.[13] Marina is also a former councillor for the Bellshill ward, replacing her father in 2012 and serving until 2017.[14]

He was co-convener of the Scottish Greens (2004–2008). Harper became an MSP in the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the first ever elected Green parliamentarian in the United Kingdom.

Early life and career[edit]
Harper was born in Thurso, Caithness. He was educated at St Marylebone Grammar School and Elgin Academy, Moray. He graduated from the University of Aberdeen in 1962. He worked as an English teacher in Kenya, then a Modern Studies teacher at Boroughmuir High School, Edinburgh.[2]Harper was a member of Lothian Children's Panel 1985–1988 and Lothian Health Council 1993–1998.[3]
Political career[edit]
Harper joined the Ecology Party's Scottish branch in 1985.  At the time, the branch only had 35 members, and its AGM that year was held in his flat. He was elected unopposed as its convenor and secretary, and remained a leading figure as it became first the UK-wide Green Party, then the independent Scottish Greens.[4]He stood, unsuccessfully, as a Green candidate in the 1995 Perth and Kinross by-election, and for Edinburgh Pentlands in the 1997 United Kingdom general election, finishing seventh and sixth respectively.[5][6]
Scottish Parliament[edit]
Harper stood for election at the first ever Scottish Parliament election in 1999, and was elected as an additional member for the Lothians region, becoming the first ever elected Green Party parliamentarian in British political history. In an emotional speech, he promised to be a critical voice on the environment in the newly created devolved Parliament.[7] He criticised the Scottish Executive's decision to split ministerial responsibility for the environment in 2001.[8] He served as his party's sole representative in the first Parliament (1999–2003) until the 2003 election,[9] when the Scottish Green Party won another 6 seats in the regional lists.[10][11] Harper was sworn in by giving the formal affirmation, also adding: ""On behalf of the Scottish Green Party I wish to affirm that our priority will be to serve the people of Scotland who are sovereign in this land.""[12] He was the party's spokesman on education and young people.[13] In 2004, he was a member of the Scottish Parliament team in the TV general knowledge show University Challenge: The Professionals. He and fellow team members Richard Baker (Labour), Stewart Stevenson (SNP) and Jamie Stone (Lib Dem) who was captain, beat a Welsh Assembly team by 110 points to 75.[14]In January 2007, The Scotsman reported that Harper was being considered for the next Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. Harper stated that he did not know of this story, but said ""it would be an honour even to be considered"".[15] Following the 2007 elections to the Scottish Parliament, Harper was returned as a list MSP for the Lothians,[16] this time one of only two Green Party members elected.[17] After an agreement with the Scottish National Party, the party with the largest mandate from the election, the Green MSPs including Harper voted for Alex Salmond to become First Minister of Scotland but the Greens declined to enter a formal coalition with the Scottish National Party. As part of the deal, fellow Green MSP Patrick Harvie was nominated to head the Holyrood Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee.[18] In 2009, Harper and Harvie voted to reject an SNP government budget.[19] He did not seek re-election in 2011.[20]
After Parliament[edit]
Dear Mr. Harper, Harper's autobiography written with journalist Fred Bridgland, was published in 2011.[21]In September 2014, Harper became chairman of the Scottish Wildlife Trust.[22] He remained in that role for three years.[23]At the beginning of December 2013, Harper announced that he would ""absolutely vote no"" in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, going on to say that he would be happy to help the Better Together campaign and that there was a ""significant minority"" of Greens who were opposed to independence.[24]In August 2021, Harper criticised the Bute House Agreement that the Greens had struck with Nicola Sturgeon's government, claiming that his party had failed to take tougher action on North Sea oil, marine protection and taxation.[25]In September 2022, he joined the board of Gordon Brown's unionist think tank, Our Scottish Future.[26]In August 2023, he announced that he had resigned from the Scottish Green Party, citing differences of opinion on independence and concerns over what he described as the party's move to the left.[27] Harper also stated his intention to vote Labour at the next election.[28][29]
Patronage[edit]
Harper has been a patron of many organisations including LGBT Youth Scotland, an organisation dedicated to the inclusion and advancement of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people in Scotland. He was an Honorary Vice-President of English-Speaking Union Scotland. He served as Rector of the University of Edinburgh 2000–2003.[30] Harper was an Honorary President of the Edinburgh University Savoy Opera Group.[31] He was elected as Rector of the University of Aberdeen in 2005.
He was President of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts 2008–2011.[32]

Political career[edit]
Campbell joined the Scottish National Party in 1995.
Campbell stood for the North East Fife constituency at the 2005 and 2010 general elections, although he was unsuccessful and failed to unseat Menzies Campbell of the Liberal Democrats. Campbell also stood unsuccessfully at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, where Iain Smith successfully retained the North East Fife seat.
At the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Campbell beat Smith in the contest, and was elected as the MSP for North East Fife. As a MSP, he was a member of the European and External Relations Committee and the Justice Committee.[3] At the 2016 Campbell finished second to Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, and was not elected.

Personal detailsBorn (1951-07-27) 27 July 1951 (age 72)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materUniversity of Western AustraliaUniversity of EdinburghUniversity of AberdeenProfessionSolicitor, AdvocateRoseanna Cunningham (born 27 July 1951) is a retired Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who served as Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform from 2016 to 2021. She was previously Cabinet Secretary for Fair Work, Skills and Training from 2014 until 2016.
She served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Perth from 1999 to 2011, and then for Perthshire South and Kinross-shire from 2011 to 2021. She was formerly Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth and Kinross from 1995 to 1997 then for Perth 1997 to 2001.

Early life, education and legal practice[edit]
Cunningham was born on 27 July 1951 in Glasgow to Catherine and Hugh Cunningham,[1] and spent her early years living in East Lothian and Edinburgh. In 1960, she emigrated with her family to Perth in Australia, and completed her schooling at John Curtin High School in Fremantle. As a teenager, she became interested in politics, and in 1969 joined the SNP as an overseas member. In 1975 Cunningham graduated from the University of Western Australia with a BA Hons in politics.[1] She returned to Scotland in 1976.
She worked as a research assistant at SNP headquarters from 1977 to 1979,[1] and was a member of the left-wing 79 Group inside the SNP during the early 1980s, but avoided expulsion as she was not a member of its steering committee (future SNP leader Alex Salmond by contrast who served on the 79 Group committee was expelled, while Margo MacDonald resigned from the party in protest before she could be expelled).
Cunningham returned to university in 1980, graduating from the University of Edinburgh in 1982 with a Bachelor of Laws degree, followed in 1983 by a Diploma in Legal Practice from the University of Aberdeen.[1] She worked as a solicitor for Dumbarton District Council and Glasgow District Council. After a brief period in private practice, she was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1990.[1]
Political career[edit]
In the 1992 general election Cunningham stood in the Perth and Kinross constituency, losing by around 2,000 votes.[2]In 1995, she gained the seat in the Perth and Kinross by-election succeeding the recently deceased Conservative MP, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.[3] She had initially been left off the SNP's candidate shortlist over her brief relationship in the 1970s with Donald Bain, then husband of SNP MP Margaret Ewing, on the grounds that the issue could prove an embarrassment to the party. Cunningham said the affair had begun after the couple had separated.[4] She was put back in contention following an intervention by the then party leader Alex Salmond, and after Ewing made clear she had no objection to Cunningham's candidature. In the 1997 election, she stood for the Perth constituency and was elected.[5]In 1999 she became the MSP for Perth. In 2000, she was elected the SNP Senior Vice-Convener (depute leader). Also in that year, she helped establish the Scottish Left Review publication. She stood down as an MP in 2001, to concentrate on the Scottish Parliament.
John Swinney announced his resignation as leader of the SNP on 22 June 2004, and on the same day, Cunningham announced that she would be a candidate in the subsequent election for the party leadership. In the early stages of the campaign, she appeared to be the clear front-runner, but former leader Alex Salmond entered the race just before nominations closed and Cunningham finished a distant second.[6]In December 2006, she led an unsuccessful attempt to prevent same-sex couples from gaining the right to adopt children,[7] despite having previously been named ScotsGay Parliamentarian of the Year in 1998.[8]  When legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland was passed by the Scottish Parliament in February 2014, she voted against the bill.[9]In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government in February 2009, Cunningham was appointed as Minister for the Environment.[10] In December 2010, she also took on portfolio responsibility for climate change, becoming Minister for the Environment and Climate Change. After the 2011 election, which saw an SNP landslide, she was appointed Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs with special responsibility for tackling sectarianism.
In Nicola Sturgeon's first reshuffle in November 2014, she was promoted to Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Fair Work, Skills and Training.
She announced on 21 August 2020 that she would step down as an MSP in the 2021 Scottish election.[11]

Personal detailsBorn (1948-03-03) 3 March 1948 (age 75)Irvine, North Ayrshire, ScotlandPolitical partySSP (until 2006)Solidarity (2006-2021)Rosemary Byrne (born 3 March 1948, Irvine, North Ayrshire) is a Scottish politician who served as co-convenor of Solidarity from 2006 to 2019.
Byrne was a  Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South of Scotland region from 2003 to 2007.  She was elected as a Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) MSP but in September 2006, together with Tommy Sheridan, she left that party to form Solidarity.
Byrne lives in Irvine, and was a teacher and a trade union activist for several years. At one time she was president of Irvine Trades Council.

Political career[edit]
She stood unsuccessfully in the 2001 United Kingdom general election as the Scottish Socialist Party candidate for Cunninghame South (UK Parliament constituency).[1]In the 2003 Scottish Parliament election Byrne stood as the Scottish Socialist Party candidate for the Cunninghame South constituency to the Scottish Parliament, where she received 2,677 votes and came third.[2] She was elected to a regional seat from the SSP's list.[3]The SSP returned six MSPs at the 2003 election. Byrne was the only one of the six who was not already a member of the SSP executive, she was arguably the least prominent.  She was elected to the executive in early 2004, and at the February 2005 conference she was elected as one of the SSP's co-chairs.  However she did not stand for re-election to this post or the executive committee at its conference in March 2006, stating that she was standing down for personal reasons.
On 3 September Sheridan and Byrne launched a new political party, naming it Solidarity – Scotland's Socialist Movement.[4]
Sheridan vs. News International[edit]

Following this, Sheridan and Byrne split from the SSP, and formed a new socialist party which they named Solidarity.[5]During the trial, in which Sheridan sued the News of the World for defamation and won, Byrne gave evidence supporting Sheridan. On 1 October 2006 the News of the World published fresh evidence which it claimed proved that their allegations were true and Sheridan had thus lied to the Court of Session during the trial. Sheridan was subsequently charged with and eventually convicted of perjury.
Both Byrne and Sheridan were accused by the IWW of betraying workers by unilaterally removing funding from the collective body which employed parliamentary staff.[6]On 15 February 2008, Byrne was arrested on suspicion of perjury in relation to the Sheridan defamation trial.[7] However, the Crown Office said that the matter would not be taken further at the conclusion of the subsequent criminal trial.[citation needed]In June 2016, Sheridan resigned from his position as co-convener of the Solidarity, with councillor Pat Lee elected to replace him alongside Byrne.[8]

She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow Region from 2003 to 2007.

Political history[edit]
Introduction to politics[edit]
Kane entered politics after becoming involved in a campaign against the extension of the M77 motorway. In 1996 she was the first ever candidate of the newly formed Scottish Socialist Alliance when she contested a Glasgow City Council by-election in the Toryglen ward, an area threatened by the M74 extension plan, and came third with 18% of the vote. After this she was an election candidate a number of times for the Scottish Socialist Alliance and its successor the Scottish Socialist Party. She served on the National Executive committee of the party for a number of years and as the party's environmental spokesperson, writing a column ""One World"" for the Scottish Socialist Voice.

Parliamentary work (2003–2007)[edit]
Kane stood for election to the Scottish Parliament in 2003, and was placed second on the party's list in Glasgow region. She was elected alongside Tommy Sheridan, who was first on the list.[1][2] In her victory speech, she stated how she planned to shake up the Parliament, stating ""They're going to be amazed at all the madness and craziness that's going to happen in there"".[3]MSPs are required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen before they can take their seat in Parliament. As the Scottish Socialist Party is a republican party, their MSPs held various protests during the oath ceremony, during which Kane took her oath with her hand raised which had the words ""My oath is to the people"" written on it.[4]On 6 November 2003, Kane appeared on Question Time alongside the SNP's Alex Salmond, Labour MSP Cathy Jamieson, Tory MP Francis Maude and Peter Oborne of The Spectator. Host David Dimbleby referred to her contribution as ""eloquent and intriguing"". According to the Scottish Socialist Voice, Kane faced accusations from the audience that the SSP were slow to condemn Palestinian suicide bombers — she responded by saying she ""condemned all attacks on innocent people, emphasising Israel's fault regarding non-negotiations in the on-going conflict"".[5]In late 2003, she announced that she was taking a short break from politics to deal with clinical depression. She returned to work early in 2004.[6][7]In 2005, Kane accepted an invitation to meet Fidel Castro at a conference in Cuba.[8][9] Later in 2005, she took part in an anti-nuclear protest, locking herself to a model of a nuclear submarine outside the Scottish Parliament building.[10] She was fined £150 for the demonstration, and was imprisoned in Cornton Vale for 14 days in October 2006 after refusing to pay. In January 2007, she was arrested but not charged for taking part in a peaceful anti-nuclear demonstration at Faslane, as part of the Faslane 365 campaign.
In June 2005, along with fellow socialist MSPs Carolyn Leckie, Frances Curran, and Colin Fox, she was suspended from the Scottish Parliament for the month of September for disrupting parliamentary proceedings in a peaceful protest in the chamber. They were highlighting the issue of the right to protest outside the Gleneagles Hotel, the site of the 31st G8 summit.
During her time in parliament, she also campaigned against the treatment of toxic waste in South East Glasgow, against water fluoridation and against GM crops. She remains active in the fight to end the detention of children at Dungavel asylum detention centre, as well as campaigns for migrants rights and against dawn raids. She personally paid the bail for a Cameroonian woman called Mercy Ikolo and her Ireland-born 18-month-old baby to allow them to leave the centre, inviting them to stay with her and her daughters in their tenement flat until their visa issues were resolved.

After leaving parliament[edit]
Kane stood as the no. 1 candidate for her party on the Glasgow regional list for the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. The SSP polled 2,579 votes in the Glasgow region and failed to re-elect any candidates. Since September 2012, Kane has been involved in the Women for Independence campaign for Scottish independence.[11][12] In April 2015, she organised a vigil in George Square in Glasgow in relation to the killing of Karen Buckley.[13]
Other information[edit]
Kane is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (Wobblies) and became a grandmother in February 2011.[14]In 2011, Kane played the role of a mother in a play written by future SSP co-spokesperson Sandra Webster as part of the National Theatre of Scotland's Five Minute Theatre project. The play was inspired by Sandra's experience of bringing up her two autistic sons.[15] She also appeared in An Evening with Rosie Kane in May 2012[16] and played herself in I, Tommy in September 2013.[17]

Personal detailsBornJames Ross Finnie (1947-02-11) 11 February 1947 (age 76)Greenock, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Liberal DemocratsOccupationAccountantJames Ross Finnie (born 11 February 1947)[1] is a Scottish Liberal Democrat politician and a former Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP). He is a former Minister for the Environment and Rural Development in the Scottish Executive, and Member of the Scottish Parliament for the West of Scotland region. He became an MSP in the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, and held the same ministerial portfolio until May 2007.

Background[edit]
Finnie was educated at Greenock Academy.[1] Previously a self-employed chartered accountant and financial adviser, he was a councillor in Inverclyde from 1977 to 1999. He also previously chaired the Scottish Liberal Party, before chairing the Scottish Liberal Democrats. In the 1979 general election he was the Liberal candidate in Renfrewshire West, and four years later he contested Stirling.

Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
He stood for election to the Scottish Parliament at the first elections in 1999. He came second in the Greenock and Inverclyde constituency, but was elected as an additional member for the West of Scotland region.[2] He was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2003[3] and 2007.[4]Following the 1999 election, the Scottish Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition agreement with the Scottish Labour Party, gaining two seats in the Scottish Cabinet. Finnie was appointed Minister for Rural Development in the first Scottish cabinet by then First Minister, Donald Dewar[5] Finnie retained his position in the Cabinet since 1999 until the Labour-Liberal Democrat government lost power in 2007, making him the longest-serving member of the Scottish cabinet, other than Jack McConnell who was First Minister.
One of the main events in Finnie's time as Minister for Environment and Rural Affairs was the outbreak of foot and mouth in the UK during 2001. Scotland was praised for its response and handling of the crisis.[6]In January 2004, Finnie took a three-month absence from office to undergo heart bypass surgery and returned in April, after deputy minister Allan Wilson had fulfilled Finnie's ministerial duties.[7]Finnie was unsuccessful in his bid to be re-elected in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, losing his seat after 12 years.

Leadership contest[edit]
On 7 July 2008, Ross Finnie announced his intention to stand in the election for leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, following the resignation of Nicol Stephen MSP. On 26 August 2008, he was defeated by Tavish Scott.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In September 2002, Finnie apologised to Digby Jones, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, after branding him an ""English prat"" at a dinner following a controversial speech by Mr Jones.[9]Later that month, Finnie apologised for giving wrong information to the Scottish Parliament during a debate. He had told Parliament that sheep were no longer grazing on the banks of Loch Katrine, which provides Glasgow with its drinking water (a previous outbreak of the cryptosporidium bug in the Loch was believed to have been caused by livestock grazing at the Loch's shores). However, Scottish Water later contacted him to say that the sheep were still there and would not be removed until September 2007. Both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives made calls for Finnie to be sacked, although the First Minister, Jack McConnell gave him his support.[10]In June 2006, Finnie cancelled a tender for a new fishery protection vessel for the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. The tender has been provisionally awarded to English firm Appledore, but Finnie claimed there was a ""fatal flaw"" in the tendering process which could have left the Executive liable for damages if the tender had proceeded. However, the Scotland on Sunday reported that a rival bidder, Port Glasgow based Ferguson's was both in Finnie's constituency, and that he was a lifelong friend of the chief executive.[11]
Water Industry Commission for Scotland[edit]
In December 2011, it was announced that he would become a non-executive member of the Water Industry Commission for Scotland,[12] taking up the position in July 2012.[13]
Food Standards Scotland[edit]
In November 2014, his appointment as the chair of Food Standards Scotland was announced.[14]

A member of the Scottish Greens, he was the youngest MSP elected in the 2016 election.

Early life and career[edit]
Beaker was educated at Bearsden Academy, leaving in 2012.[1][2] Greer was a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament, representing the Clydebank and Milngavie constituency 2011–13.[3] Greer joined the Scottish Greens at the age of 15.[4]  He took part in the Debating Matters competition in 2012, where he reached the national final.[5]Greer dropped out of a place at the University of Strathclyde due to finding the struggles of university too difficult. Greer struggled to make friends and could deal with studying alone. [6] After the referendum, he was employed by the Scottish Greens in a role involving campaigns communications and fundraising.[6]
Political career[edit]
Ross Greer in October 2022Greer stood as the Scottish Green candidate in the East Dunbartonshire constituency in the 2015 general election, securing 5th place with 804 votes (1.5%).[4] He became the Scottish Greens' party spokesman on Europe and external affairs.[6] In March 2015, the Scottish Greens announced Greer had been selected as the lead candidate for their West Scotland regional list, following a ballot of their members.[7]Ahead of the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Greer was critical that the general level of engagement with 16 and 17-year-olds as first-time voters had been below what was seen in the referendum.[8] On 6 May 2016, he was elected with 17,218 votes (5.3%) as an additional member for the West Scotland region. Elected at the age of 21 years old, he became Scotland's youngest MSP.[9] Before Greer was elected, the youngest MSP had previously been Labour's Mark Griffin, who was 25 years old when he was first elected in 2011.[1] On 22 May, he was appointed the Scottish Greens' spokesperson for International Development and External Affairs, Education and Skills, and Culture and Media.[10]Like his Green colleagues, Greer is opposed to an independent Scotland joining NATO. He told the Daily Record:[11]
NATO is a 'first strike' nuclear alliance, meaning it claims the right to launch its weapons of mass slaughter against other countries without having been attacked first. There can never, ever be justification for murdering millions of innocent people like that. For this reason alone, never mind NATO's history of provoking rather than avoiding conflict, the Scottish Greens are clear that an independent Scotland should follow Ireland's lead and stay out. Instead, we should immediately sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which would not only make the Trident submarines at Faslane illegal and force their removal, it would also show that we refuse to let others use weapons of mass destruction on our behalf.
Greer currently serves as the co-chair of the Scottish Greens Executive Committee.[12]
Controversy[edit]
In 2019, Greer was strongly criticised for having posted a tweet, while a secondary school student, in June 2012 which read ""I'm not exaggerating when I say nothing would thrill me more than for Buckingham Palace to burn to the ground.""[13]On 25 January 2019, Greer posted a tweet calling Winston Churchill ""a white supremacist mass murderer."" He later went on Good Morning Britain and Politics Live and was challenged on his views.[14][15] This was not the first time Greer has been criticised for his comments about the Second World War; a few years prior he was criticised in The Sun after tweeting that ""Imperial Britain was happy to live with Hitler"" in reference to the policy of Appeasement.[13]
Personal life[edit]
Greer is a member of the Church of Scotland.[16]

Thomson was the first Conservative MP elected for Aberdeen South since the 1992 general election, 25 years earlier.[1] He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the North East Scotland region from May 2016 until June 2017.[2] He was elected to Aberdeen City Council in the 2012 local elections.[3][4]
Early life[edit]
Thomson was born in Aberdeen and educated locally at Bridge of Don Academy.[5] He studied Politics and International Relations at the University of Aberdeen, graduating with a first class MA (Hons) degree in 2009.[6]Prior to entering politics, Thomson worked as a store trainer for department store Debenhams.[7]
Political career[edit]
He stood for the Scottish Parliament at the 2007 elections for the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency, coming third behind Labour MSP Elaine Smith and the Scottish National Party candidate.[8] He was also third in Aberdeen Donside in 2011.
At the United Kingdom general election in 2010, Thomson was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the Scottish constituency of Gordon, and finished in fourth place, receiving 9,111 votes. He was the youngest Conservative Party candidate for the House of Commons.[9][better source needed] He was elected to the Aberdeen City Council at the 2012 election.[4]Thomson contested the Aberdeen Donside by-election in 2013, finishing in fourth place. He stood as the Conservatives' candidate in Aberdeen South during the 2015 general election, but was unsuccessful, and subsequently stood in the Aberdeen South and North Kincardine constituency at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. Although the Scottish National Party's Maureen Watt retained the latter seat,[10] Thomson was elected through the Additional Member System as one of the seven representatives of the North East Scotland region.[11]During his time as a Member of the Scottish Parliament, Thomson was the Scottish Conservative spokesperson for Further Education, Higher Education and Science,[12] and sat on the Education and Skills Committee.[13] Thomson also became a spokesman for Vote Leave in Scotland during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum as one of the few members of the Scottish Parliament supporting a leave vote.[14][15]On 5 October 2016, Thomson repaid expenses relating to a night's stay in an Edinburgh hotel with a male friend whom he subsequently hired.[16]On 8 June 2017, Thomson became the Member of Parliament for Aberdeen South, defeating incumbent Callum McCaig, with 18,746 votes, a 19.3% swing and a majority of 4,752.[17] He stood down from his seat as an MSP after being elected as a Westminster MP.[18] Since entering the UK Parliament, Thomson has become known as a ""hardline"" supporter of Brexit.[19]In April 2018, Thomson was criticised for posts made on his private social media account whilst visiting Baghdad. Thomson was accused of trivialising the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein when he posed for photos at Hussein's military parade ground. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ""Ross has already made clear he did not intend to cause any offence and apologises to anyone who has been upset.""[20]He supported Boris Johnson in the 2019 Conservative leadership election and became his campaign manager in Scotland.[21] After the 2022 vote of confidence in the Conservative Party leadership of Boris Johnson Thomson, no longer an MP, described Johnson as ""wounded"" and called on him to ""build bridges"" with the Scottish party.[22]
Post-parliamentary career[edit]
After stepping down as an MP, Thomson has worked as a public affairs and campaign manager for the Earl Haig Fund Scotland (also known as Poppyscotland').[23]
Personal life[edit]
Thomson entered into a civil partnership with his partner in November 2013, which lasted until 2018.[24]On 29 November 2018, Callum Purdie was convicted at Aberdeen Sheriff Court of causing a disturbance at the constituency office of Thomson.[25] The following month, Purdie, who was not one of Thomson's constituents, was ordered to stay away from Thomson's office and his staff for two years.[26]
Sexual misconduct allegations[edit]
On 6 February 2019, various newspapers reported that Thomson had been escorted by police from the Strangers' Bar of the House of Commons the previous evening. Initial reports indicated that police had attended following reports of sexual assault of patrons by the MP. Eyewitnesses claimed that Thomson had repeatedly groped several young men also present in the bar, grabbing their bottoms and genitals. A Conservative Party investigation is yet to conclude, but the Parliamentary Commissioner on Standards dismissed the complaint.[27][28][29][30]
Thomson denied any wrongdoing, citing the allegations as politically motivated.[31]On 3 November 2019 MP Paul Sweeney accused Thomson of sexual assault in the Strangers' Bar in October 2018.[32] The same day Thomson announced that he would not stand for re-election as the Member of Parliament for Aberdeen South, denying the allegation and stating that it had made his life 'a living hell'.[33] It later emerged that the chairman of Thomson's local Conservative Association had refused to sign the nomination papers to allow him to stand as a Conservative candidate in the December 2019 general election.[34]In October 2020, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards ""concluded that Thomson's behaviour was not sexual in nature and cleared him of any breach of parliament’s misconduct policy"".[35]
Notes[edit]

^ Normally, regional MSPs do not have individual predecessors and successors. However, Thomson stood down during a sitting parliament so was succeeded by Mason.

Personal detailsBorn1972 or 1973 (age 51–52)[1]Political partyScottish ConservativesRussell Findlay is a Scottish politician and journalist who has served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West Scotland region since 2021.[2] A member of the Scottish Conservatives, he served as the party's director of communications.[3]
Journalist career[edit]
Findlay worked as a journalist for STV, the Scottish Sun and Sunday Mail.  His investigation into the disappearance of Margaret Fleming was used to help prosecute her killers. He has written three books, one of which is about his acid attack, and co-authored a fourth.[1]
Acid attack[edit]
In December 2015, while working as a journalist for The Sun reporting on gangs in Glasgow, he was subjected to a doorstep acid attack. William Burns disguised himself as a postal worker and threw sulphuric acid on Findlay before attacking with a knife. Findlay managed to hold Burns down long enough for the police to arrive and arrest him. Burns was sentenced to a ten-year jail term with five years of post-release supervision. Ten months before the attack, Gordon Smart, editor of The Sun, received a call that included threats against Findlay, which Smart did not reveal until days after the attack. Findlay initially returned to work for The Sun but later took sick leave and left with an agreement from his employer.[4]
Political career[edit]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Findlay was selected as the Scottish Conservatives candidate for the Paisley constituency in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. Failing to win the seat and coming third, he was elected to the party list as an additional member for the West Scotland region.
On 12 January 2022, Findlay called for Boris Johnson to resign as Conservative party leader and Prime Minister over the Westminster lockdown parties controversy along with a majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs.[5]On 27 December 2022, Findlay posted on Twitter a picture of himself holding a merkin, with a group of people in a pub, including Elaine Miller, who had flashed the Scottish Parliament and then those in the gallery, from the  gallery, following the conclusion of the last debate on the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill. [6] In the post he criticised the police's decision to investigate Miller over her self-declared indecency.

University of GlasgowMilitary serviceAllegianceUnited KingdomBranch/serviceTerritorial ArmyYears of service2003–2006RankSignallerUnit32 Signal RegimentRuth Elizabeth Davidson, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, PC (born 10 November 1978), is a Scottish politician who served as Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party from 2011 to 2019 and Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament from 2020 to 2021. She served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow from 2011 to 2016 and for Edinburgh Central from 2016 to 2021.
Born in Edinburgh, Davidson was raised in Selkirk and later attended Buckhaven High School in Fife. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh, she worked as a BBC journalist and served in the Territorial Army as a signaller. After leaving the BBC in 2009 to study at the University of Glasgow, she joined the Conservative Party. At the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Davidson was elected on the Glasgow regional list. Following party leader Annabel Goldie's resignation in May 2011, Davidson stood in the subsequent leadership election.
She won the contest and was declared party leader on 4 November 2011. In 2016, the Conservatives replaced the Labour Party as the second-largest party in the Scottish Parliament. Davidson resigned the leadership in August 2019, shortly after Boris Johnson became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She was succeeded by Jackson Carlaw who was replaced by Douglas Ross. After leading the party in Holyrood for several months, Davidson stood down at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. In 2021, she was appointed a life peer in the House of Lords.
Davidson was generally considered a fairly successful leader, especially in 2016 and 2017. Ideologically, she is considered a centrist. She supported Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. In the years after 2014, she continued to appeal to ""No"" voters in the referendum on that basis along with opposition to a second vote. She supported the UK remaining in the European Union in the 2016 EU membership referendum.

Early life and career[edit]
Davidson was born at the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion.[1] She was raised in Selkirk and later in Fife. Her family lived in Raeburn Place and then Bridgelands Road, Selkirk, and Davidson attended Knowepark Primary School until Primary 3.[2][3][a] Her father, Douglas, a mill manager at Laidlaw & Fairgrieve, had played professional football for Partick Thistle F.C. in his younger days and was a midfielder for Selkirk F.C. during the late-1970s and early-1980s. When her father took a job in the whisky industry, the family left the Borders for Fife, where she attended the state secondary Buckhaven High School.[4][5] Her parents voted Conservative but were not especially involved in politics.[6]Davidson studied English literature at the University of Edinburgh, gaining an undergraduate Master of Arts (MA Hons) degree.[7][8][9] After graduation, she joined the Glenrothes Gazette as a trainee reporter. She later moved to Kingdom FM, followed by Real Radio, and finally joined BBC Scotland in late 2002 where she worked as a radio journalist, producer, presenter and reporter. She left the BBC in 2009 to study International Development at the University of Glasgow.[5][10] She also served as a signaller in the 32 Signal Regiment[11] of the Territorial Army for three years (2003–06) before suffering a back injury in a training exercise at Sandhurst.[12][5][10]
Early political career[edit]
In 2009, after having left the BBC to study at the University of Glasgow, Davidson joined the Conservative Party. She said she was inspired by a call by David Cameron, the then Leader of the Opposition, in the wake of the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, for people who had never previously been political to get involved in politics. She was encouraged by the Scottish Conservative Party's Director of Media, Ramsay Jones,[13] to join the party and stand for the House of Commons seat of Glasgow North East at the 2009 by-election, which was triggered by the resignation of Labour MP and Speaker of the House, Michael Martin. She finished in third place, with 1,075 votes (5.2% share of the vote).[14]From early 2010 to March 2011, she worked as the head of the private office of the then Scottish Conservative leader, Annabel Goldie.[15][16] She played a large part in the organisation of campaign media events in the run-up to the 2010 general election,[16] at which she ran again in Glasgow North East, finishing in fourth place with 1,569 votes (a 5.3% share of the vote).[17][18]
Election to Scottish Parliament and first roles[edit]
For the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Davidson contested the Glasgow Kelvin constituency and was initially placed second on the Conservatives' Glasgow region list, behind Malcolm Macaskill.[19] A few months before the election it was reported in the press that Macaskill had failed to fully disclose his business career to party members ahead of a 2010 internal party selection contest.[19][20][21][22] On 24 March, Andrew Fulton, the Chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, decided that Macaskill was to be deselected, thereby promoting Davidson to the first position in the Glasgow regional list.[19][21] This led to protests from the supporters of Macaskill, and some major donors withdrew their financial support for the party.[21] In the election, after coming a distant fourth in Glasgow Kelvin, Davidson was elected to the Scottish Parliament from the Glasgow region list.[23] After the election she was appointed by Goldie as the Conservative spokesperson for Culture, Europe and External Relations.[5]
Leadership of the Scottish Conservative Party[edit]
Election bid[edit]
See also: 2011 Scottish Conservatives leadership election
After a poor result for her party at the election, Annabel Goldie resigned as Scottish Conservative leader on 9 May 2011.[24] Davidson became a contender in the subsequent leadership election.[25] Her rivals later claimed that Davidson received assistance from Party headquarters, though her supporters stated that these claims were part of a smear campaign.[19] She stood against three other candidates – Murdo Fraser, Jackson Carlaw and Margaret Mitchell. Fraser stood on a platform of separating the Scottish Conservatives from the UK-wide party and establishing a new Scottish centre-right party. Davidson announced her candidacy on 4 September and vehemently opposed Fraser's proposals to separate the party, calling it a ""distraction"" which would ""tie the party in knots"".[26] Academic Alexander Smith described Davidson as ideologically aligned with the party's centrists while Fraser was associated with the party's right.[27]Davidson's campaign was endorsed by two MSPs and a former Secretary of State for Scotland, Lord Forsyth.[28] She was also supported by the conservatives sole MP in Scotland David Mundell.[27] Despite being a List MSP for Glasgow, she failed to gain the endorsement of a single chairperson of any of the five Conservative Constituency Associations in Glasgow[13] and over half the MSP group had supported Murdo Fraser.[28]On 11 September 2011, Davidson sacked her election agent and parliamentary assistant Ross McFarlane. He had been filmed trying to burn a European Union flag in a Glasgow street following a University Conservative Association (GUCA) St Andrew's Day dinner in November 2010.[29] On 5 October 2011, the Scottish Conservative media director Ramsay Jones was suspended from his duties during the leadership contest, after it was revealed that he had met Davidson and her campaign team in her flat on Sunday, 18 September.[30][31]Davidson subsequently won the leadership election and was made the leader of the Scottish Conservatives on 4 November 2011. She gained 2,278 first preference votes out of the 5,676 votes cast, after second preference votes were counted, she won by 2,983 votes to runner up Murdo Fraser's 2,417.[32] This sparked some discontent within the party, with prominent party supporter Paul McBride resigning from the party[33] and party donor John McGlynn criticised her election, saying that she was elected through ""interference"".[34]
Early leadership[edit]
At Davidson's first Scottish conservative conference leadership speech, she announced the introduction of a new Logo for the Scottish Conservatives featuring an eight-pronged cross arguing that it was ""distinctly Scottish but with colours which clearly reflect our pride in the United Kingdom"". At her first electoral test at the 2012 local elections the Scottish Conservatives lost seats, leading to some worry and talk of a leadership coup in party circles.[28] According to a profile by Ian Leslie in the New Statesman, the early part of Davidson's leadership was difficult. She made what he called a ""prolonged and embarrassing climb-down"" from a pledge to oppose any further devolution of powers to the Scottish parliament and struggled in parliamentary debates with Alex Salmond. Although, he also writes that she began to get attention through social media and reformed the party's processes of selecting candidates for the Scottish Parliament.[6]David Torrance wrote that after a year in office Davidson ""had little to show in terms of policy development, strategic direction or opinion polls"".[28]Telegraph columnist Alan Cochrane was deeply critical writing in his diary at the time that:She [Davidson] is totally and utterly useless and so are her team. They haven’t a bloody clue but she is the problem – big problem. Not up to the job, as Attlee would say, and I suspect that some hacks[b] will start asking questions. [David] Mundell said he knew she wasn’t cutting the mustard . . . But he claims they’ve got someone lined up to help her. Christ, they need it. They’re all just bairns [children] in her office and I suspect the Tory MSPs ain’t helping her.[28]Davidson as secondary opposition leader at a Scottish Parliament FMQs, 2014Davidson began to ""modernise"" the party's stance in the mold of changes Cameron was also making at the time. Expressing support for greater devolution and same-sex marriage. As time past, a few positive signs began to appear for Davidson's electoral prospects. The upcoming referendum attracted more support in the sense of activists and financial assistance to the party. Cameron’s Caledonian Conundrum, a 2013 report by Michael Ashcroft into the Conservatives electoral prospects in Scotland, identified a substantial number of voters outside their base of support that were attracted by aspects of the conservative brand such as seeing Cameron as the best candidate for prime minister or agreeing with the Conservative argument on the economy. These potential swing voters had ""a generally positive view"" of Davidson remembering things about her, such as an incident when she had been asked for ID to drink alcohol at an event. John Curtice noted a small increase in the party's support in Scotland between 2012 and 2014.[28] In the 2014 European Election, the conservatives modestly increased their vote share in Scotland while losing support elsewhere.[36]2014 Scottish Independence referendum and aftermath[edit]
See also: 2014 Scottish independence referendum
She campaigned for a 'No' vote in 2014, expressing the view that Scottish independence would endanger the ""wonderful messiness of these islands"". Reflecting on the referendum some years later she said, ""I think I did cry but I don’t think until a couple of days after. It was a bit delayed, but it was pure relief.""[37] Ian Leslie argues that the referendum gave Davidson an opportunity to become a major figure in Scottish politics. He wrote that she was an effective campaigner able to make a compelling case even for aspects of UK policy which were not popular in Scotland, such as Trident.[6] David Patrick argues that while the referendum helped Davidson to gain more media coverage she was not one of the main figures in the debate.[38]Davidson speaking at the 2014 Conservative Party conferenceWhen Alex Salmond resigned as First Minister of Scotland, Davidson nominated herself to succeed him. She knew that the SNP's majority virtually assured that Salmond's successor as SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, would become First Minister. Nevertheless, she felt the need to offer ""an alternative vision of Scotland"".  Davidson received 15 votes to Sturgeon's 66.[39] David Torrance argues that she began a strategy of attempting to appeal to ""No"" voters on the basis of their vote. Davidson called Sturgeon a referendum ""denier"" and implied that she wanted another vote in the near future.[28] The Scottish Conservatives had no improvement in their poll ratings in the six months after the referendum and at the 2015 general election the Conservatives vote share fell by a small amount in Scotland.[40][28]Following the referendum, a year-long police investigation took place into allegations that pro-Union campaigners, including Davidson, had breached secrecy provisions of the Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013. In September 2015, detectives reported their findings to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.[41]Police Scotland stated, in reference to the report, that no evidence of criminality was found, and consequently there was no charge to answer.[42]
2016 EU referendum and aftermath[edit]
Before the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum held on 23 June 2016, she campaigned against British withdrawal from the European Union.[43][44][45] On 21 June 2016, she participated in the BBC's Wembley Arena Debate, as a panellist for the ""Remain"" campaign with Frances O'Grady and Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Their opponents were former Mayor of London and Conservative MP Boris Johnson, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, who argued on behalf of the ""Leave"" campaign as part of a cross-party debate.[46] She was critical of other conservatives supporting leave.[47] Ian Leslie argues that ""Davidson achieved something that nobody else did: she made the case for Remain sound thrillingly righteous""  and that her performance led to observers outside of Scotland seeing her as a major figure in British politics.[6] Commentator Martin Kettle wrote that David Cameron was making plans to move Davidson to the UK Parliament if he had won the referendum in order to position her as his successor.[48]The referendum saw 52% of British voters decide to leave the European Union, while 62% of the Scottish electorate who cast their vote backed remaining in the EU.[49] Years later Davidson reflected: ""Turns out we were 4% not good enough – but for such things the world turns – and I'll never quite forgive myself for not getting that 4%.""[50] Following the announcement of the result, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggested the constitutional change it would bring about justified the need for a second referendum on Scottish independence, but Davidson said this would not be the answer to concerns raised by the prospect of leaving the European Union: ""The 1.6 million votes cast in this referendum in favour of Remain do not wipe away the two million votes that were cast less than two years ago"". She also called on the UK and Scottish Governments to work together and put ""stability"" first.[51][52]In the Conservative leadership contest triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron, Davidson gave her backing to Home Secretary Theresa May to succeed him as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister, describing May as a ""proper grown up [who is] best placed to navigate the stormy waters ahead"".[53] Davidson was appointed to the Privy Council on 13 July 2016.[54][55] At the 2016 Conservative Party Conference, Davidson warned her party that ""immigrants should be made to feel welcome in the UK"" and the ""party should not lurch to the right in the wake of Labour's implosion"". She argued that Britain should seek access to the European Single Market even if that meant accepting reciprocal freedom of movement.[56]
Electoral gains in 2016 and 2017[edit]
Davidson meets Prince Charles, 2016In 2016 and 2017, Davidson had high approval ratings in Scotland with many voters seeing her as an unusual kind of Conservative.[47] Political commentator Stephen Bush argued that the aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum gave Davidson an opportunity to position herself and her party as the ""loudest defender of the Union"". This, he wrote, was a position with significant appeal among a section of ""No"" supporting Labour and Liberal Democrat voters at a time when Scottish Labour were focused on minimising their losses of 'Yes' supporters to the SNP. Bush was of the view that this contributed to Conservative electoral gains in Scotland over the next few years.[57]Davidson led the Scottish Conservatives into the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, where the party doubled its number of Scottish Parliament seats to 31, replacing Labour as the second largest party at Holyrood behind the Scottish National Party.[58] The election also saw Davidson, who had previously been a list MSP, win the constituency of Edinburgh Central from the SNP with 10,399 votes. Reacting to the result Davidson said, ""I am under no illusion that everybody who voted for me in that seat is a true-blue, dyed-in-the wool Tory, and neither are they in places up and down Scotland. They are people who want us to do a very specific job, and that it is to hold the SNP to account.""[59] Following the success of the Scottish Conservatives at the 2016 Scottish election, in which the party doubled its number of MSPs, a Guardian article noted that ""some in Westminster see her as a potential future leader, who could broaden the party's appeal and help tackle perceptions it is on the side of the privileged"".[60] However, Davidson dismissed the suggestion in an interview with The House magazine, describing the role of Prime Minister as ""the loneliest job in the world"".[60] But she did not rule out the prospect of becoming an MP, saying she would only do so ""for now"".[61]At the 2017 local elections, the Scottish Conservatives achieved their best results since devolution, gaining 164 seats including some surprise successes in working class neighbourhoods such as Calton in Glasgow’s East End and Ferguslie Park in Paisley (the UK's most deprived ward).[62] The 2017 general election saw the conservatives win 13 seats in Scotland, its best result since 1983.[63] In an election which was not seen as going as well for the Conservatives elsewhere commentators linked their successes in Scotland to Ruth Davidson personally.[64][65]The British General Election of 2017 notes that 'Had the [Conservative] party increased its vote share [in Scotland] only by the same amount as it did in England and Wales, it would have had just two Scottish seats rather than 13.' Though, while Davidson was popular and fought a distinct campaign from May she wasn't the only factor influencing the result.[47]   She said of the result ""Indyref2 is dead... it's time to get back to what matters to the people of Scotland – that's sorting out our schools, growing our economy and looking at our public services.""[63]
Later leadership and resignation[edit]
In early 2018 there was some evidence from polling that support for the Scottish Conservatives was falling.[28] That year she ruled out running in a future leadership election, saying she valued her mental health ""too much"".[66] She also made comments on the Brexit process, advocating British withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy and opposing a hard border in the Irish Sea. She was criticised by her opponents for opposing the introduction of Primary school testing in Scotland when it had been included in the Scottish Conservatives' 2016 manifesto. Davidson spent much of late 2018 and early 2019 on maternity leave, during which she was largely quiet on politics.[28]David Torrance argues that the last few months of her leadership were difficult for Davidson. At the 2019 European election, the Conservatives gained 12% of the vote in Scotland; higher than elsewhere, but a decrease on 2014. In the 2019 conservative leadership election, Davidson supported Boris Johnson's opponents but said she would ""work with"" him.[28]  In July 2019, Boris Johnson became prime minister.[67] A figure Davidson had criticised and mocked in previous years.[6] She opposed a no-deal Brexit, in opposition to Johnson's position at the time. Davidson was questioned on the idea of the Scottish Conservatives splitting into a separate party but said that a ""German CDU–CSU model"" was not something she supported. Though Torrance also expressed the view that the Scottish Conservatives experienced an improvement in their fortunes when the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell said Labour would not block a second Scottish independence referendum.[28]On 29 August 2019, Davidson stood down, citing several political and personal reasons for her decision to resign as leader. Davidson, whose son had been born a little less than a year earlier, said that she did not want to be separated from her family by an election campaign. She also said that she felt conflicted about the Brexit process.[68]
Later career[edit]
Return to backbenches and acting leadership[edit]
Jackson Carlaw (left) and Davidson (right) on the Scottish Conservative frontbench in 2018After her resignation, Davidson criticised Boris Johnson for suspending 21 Conservative MPs in September 2019 and said he was doing so to make sure that the moderates in his cabinet were replaced by ""more compliant Conservatives"". She also praised Amber Rudd's decision to leave the cabinet over the ""act of political vandalism"".[69]In October 2019, Davidson accepted a public relations role for lobbying firm Tulchan Communications while retaining her job as an MSP. Her employment drew into question potential conflicts of interest and the size of her salary, £50,000 for 25 days' work, in addition to her £63,000-a-year MSP's salary.[70][71] A week later, she changed her mind after meeting with parliamentary officials, although she insisted no conflict would have emerged had she still taken up the role.[72] She implied in a December 2019 interview that she might want to become UK Conservative leader in years to come, when her son was older.[73] Prior to the 2019 general election Davidson said that she would swim naked in Loch Ness if the Scottish National Party won 50 seats, but avoided the ordeal as the SNP won only 48.[74]In July 2020, when support for Scottish Independence and the SNP was at a high in the polls, Davidson's successor Jackson Carlaw resigned.[75] Davidson then lobbied for the leadership bid of Douglas Ross.[76] Later that month, it was announced she would be given a life peerage.[77] She agreed to serve as Leader of the Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament until the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, while Ross was yet to be elected to the Scottish Parliament.[78] Ross was announced as leader five days later after running unopposed.[79] In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election Davidson featured heavily on her party's campaign literature. Reportedly because she remained popular with ""floating unionist voters"".[80]
House of Lords[edit]
In July 2021, Davidson entered the House of Lords as Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, of Lundin Links in the County of Fife.[81] She made her maiden speech on 22 October 2021 when she supported Baroness Meacher's Assisted Dying Bill.[82] In other statements, she has criticised reductions of troop numbers in the British Army[83] and a UK government scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.[84] She claimed £24,521 in expenses[c] and made six contributions to debates in her first year as a member.[85]Davidson presented Football's Gambling Addiction, a Channel 4 documentary released in June 2021 about the relationship between football and the gambling industry.[86] In January 2022, it was announced that she would be presenting a weekly programme on Times Radio.[87] She said that she was ""very excited about combining my two great loves: politics and live broadcasting"".[88] In July 2023, she was appointed a non-executive director on the board of the Scottish Rugby Union.[89]
Public image[edit]
Ruth Davidson at a promotional event for the 2014 Commonwealth Games (third left)Ruth Davidson was often described in reporting as an unusual type of conservative. Her lower-middle class upbringing was frequently referenced in media coverage as an outlier in a party whose politicians were often perceived to be from privileged backgrounds. Davidson had previous experience dealing with the media from her broadcasting career and various election campaigns allowed her to improve her skills. David Patrick argued that Davidson was effective in using photo opportunities, magazine profiles and less serious sections of the news media[d] to cultivate her image. He also suggested her unionist message aligned with the views of most Scottish papers, which contributed to her receiving a positive response in the press.[38]  As the years passed, especially between 2014 and 2017, Davidson's public profile grew in both Scotland and the rest of the UK.[38][90][91] Various commentators argued that Ruth Davidson's appeal had roots in the fact that she was a clearly Scottish figure arguing against Scottish independence, something a majority had voted against in the 2014 referendum.[38] There were some reports that ordinary voters saw her as overtly Scottish and distinct from the UK conservative party.[47][28] David Patrick argued there was also an element of British nationalism in her choice of language and imagery. For instance, in 2015, she was photographed waving a British flag while riding a tank.[38]When she became leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Davidson was the first openly homosexual leader of a UK political party. Davidson later wrote that she had received messages from gay young people who appreciated seeing someone of their sexuality in a role of political leadership.[90] David Patrick wrote that she was ""in many ways defined by her sexuality in her early years as leader, particularly in the period before she became so closely associated with opposition to another independence referendum."" Noting that her sexuality received interest from early on in the gay press.[38] Jennifer Thomson and David Torrance argued in contrast that initially her sexuality played little role in her public profile. In part due to a separation she experienced in 2012 and as she was at the time a fairly fringe figure.[28][90]  Jennifer Thomson argued that as a series of electoral events in the middle of the 2010s increased Davidson's profile more attention was given to her sexuality. As time passed, Davidson began to discuss her sexuality in personal terms and appeared in a 2015 election broadcast with her partner.[90] Ian Leslie wrote in 2016 that Davidson was 'forever tagged as a “kick-boxing lesbian” in the British press.'[6]
Policies and views[edit]
Various commentators have described Davidson and where she positioned the Scottish Conservatives as centrist,[92][93][94] liberal[95] or the 'centre ground'.[96][97][98] Following Jeremy Corbyn's second internal leadership victory in 2016, she wrote an opinion piece for the Times promising to build a ""moderate Scottish Conservative party that appeals to the same people who supported Brown and Blair"".[99] A 2014 Financial Times report called Davidson an ""enthusiastic advocate of small government"".[36] A 2018 profile in Vogue stated that '[Davidson] describes herself as a “John Major” or “small-C” conservative with a strong social conscience and a belief in helping people to help themselves.'[100]
Ian Leslie wrote in a 2016 profile of Davidson that her ideals are ""profoundly conservative"" arguing that she is a ""British patriot, a churchgoer, a passionate supporter of the armed forces, an advocate for marriage, a believer in self-reliance"". Although, he also stated that in his view she is someone who entered politics as a career rather than out of ideological conviction. He notes that she only became formally involved in adulthood[e] and struggled to name politicians she regarded as role models outside of fictional literature. He continued that:[6]This lack of political nerdery is part of what makes her able to connect so directly with voters, but it is also a limitation. A consistent criticism of Davidson, even among those who admire her, is that she is not interested in policy, or at least that she does not have a set of distinctive policy ideas. This isn’t quite fair - she has published a paper on education and successfully focused attention on the attainment gap between poor and middle-class students. But she has not yet committed to a detailed alternative (a school vouchers[f] policy was raised and then quietly dropped). Other than “maintain the Union”, it is difficult to know what a Davidson-led government would do.[6]
Devolution[edit]
See also: Scottish devolution and Devolution in the United Kingdom
In her leadership campaign, Davidson initially promised to draw a ""line in the sand"" and oppose any further devolution to Scotland. In 2013, she said that the Scottish Conservatives were committed to ""more responsibility for the Scottish Parliament and a strengthening of devolution"" and set up the Strathclyde Commission to decide the party's policy on the subject.[101] She also said that conservatives were wrong to oppose the creation of the Scottish Parliament in the past.[102] In June 2014, she endorsed greater devolution arguing that it was reflective of public opinion, that the Scottish parliament being more accountable for what it spent was in line with conservative principles and that it would make it easier for her party to make an appeal based on tax cutting at Scottish Parliament elections.[36] She argued in 2017 that more devolution of powers within Scotland to local government could help promote economic growth.[103] In 2018, Ruth Davidson said in an interview that she would support a legal challenge in the Supreme Court on the basis of the Scottish Parliament voting to protect what it argued were its existing powers over Brexit.[g] She asserted that the importance of legal action was to test the complex situation in the court.[104]
Foreign affairs[edit]
In 2018, she criticised the behaviour of the charity workers in question following revelations that some employers of Oxfam in Haiti had been using prostitutes. She praised the assistance provided by foreign aid in general citing the examples of child immunisation programmes, landmine clearance and female education.[105] In 2020, she criticised Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak's decision to decrease the amount the UK promised to spend on foreign aid from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income.[106]After King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died in January 2015, the UK government decided to hang British flags at half-mast as a sign of mourning. In response, Davidson tweeted: ""Flying flags at half-mast on government buildings for the death of a Saudi king is a steaming pile of nonsense. That is all."" This tweet was in the context of recent outrage caused by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia publicly beheading a woman and sentencing a blogger to 1,000 lashes.[107] Following the Taliban's reconquest of Afghanistan in 2021, Davidson wrote an opinion piece with former Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell advocating the UK give foreign aid to HALO, a British charity they are both associated with, which helps to clear landmines in Afghanistan.[108]
Public services[edit]
In her leadership campaign, Davidson expressed support for state-funded Roman Catholic schooling in Scotland, and a belief that the Church of Scotland should open its own faith schools as well.[109] In 2017, she argued in a speech to the Scottish Conservative conference that the education system in Scotland was not functioning effectively. She criticised the Curriculum for Excellence arguing that it had made ""a generation of teachers, parents and pupils utterly confused about what is going on"".[110] In a speech in the same context in 2019 she argued that young people should be required to remain in some form of education or training up until the age of 18.[111]In 2011, she expressed support for judges being given the ability to effectively sentence perpetrators of ""the most heinous, cruel and vile"" crimes with a life sentence, with the intent that they are never released.[112] In 2018, she wrote an opinion piece arguing that early release was being used too often in the Scottish justice system and that the victims of crimes should be allowed to attend parole board hearings.[113]In 2018, she wrote an opinion piece expressing support for the NHS saying that it had saved her life following a childhood accident. She criticised the fact that the Scottish NHS had not had its funding increased by as much as its English counterpart since 2010.[114]
Social issues[edit]
A 2019 BBC News profile commented that ""In the past, Ms Davidson has referred to LGBTI rights as one thing she cares about more than her party.""[115] Davidson supported same-sex marriage in a debate on legalising the practise in Scotland stating that ""Presiding Officer, from childhood, you have known without even thinking that if you found someone you loved and who loved you in return, you would have the right to marry them... I want that right to extend to not just me but the thousands of people across Scotland who are told that the law says no and that they cannot marry the love of their life.""[101]  She urged the Republic of Ireland to vote ""Yes"" in the 2015 constitutional vote to enable same-sex marriage.[116]At a campaign event for the 2022 local elections, she criticised what she saw as incendiary language in the debate around trans rights saying that ""gotcha questions about who is a woman, who is a man, I'm not sure that helps"". She expressed the view that the rights of women and trans people ""do not have to be in conflict"" elaborating that ""let’s see how we can make things better and easier for people in the trans community who, as a minority, are vulnerable, are more open to attack, are more likely to be victims of crime, but while also seeking reassurances for rights for women that have been hard won over decades.""[117]Davidson supports legalising assisted dying. She voted against legalising the practice in Scotland in 2015, a decision which she said several years later was motivated by ""cowardice"". She said that a change in her views had been motivated by seeing the suffering caused to relatives by dementia and by having some of her religious beliefs around the ""creation of life"" challenged by her use of IVF.[118]
Personal life[edit]
On 18 February 2015, Davidson appeared in a party election broadcast in which she was seen with her same-sex partner Jen Wilson, a 33-year-old Irish woman from County Wexford.[119][120] Davidson announced her engagement to Wilson in May 2016.[121] On 26 April 2018 Davidson announced that she had become pregnant after receiving IVF treatment, and that she and Wilson were ""excited"" to be expecting their first child.[122][123] On 26 October, Davidson gave birth to a boy at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.[124]In a 2015 interview with BBC Radio Scotland, Davidson spoke about struggling with her sexuality: ""I struggled with it for a number of years actually before I would admit it to myself, never mind to anybody else. But there comes a point at which you make a decision and that decision is either that you're going to live a lie for the rest of your life, or you're going to trust yourself, and that's what I had to do.""[125] In her memoirs, published in 2018 and serialised by The Sunday Times Magazine, Davidson writes of struggling with mental health issues as a teenager, something that she says was triggered by the suicide of a boy in her village.[66] She has said that these struggles almost dissuaded her from running for leadership.[126]Davidson is a member of the Church of Scotland and counts dog walking, hillwalking and kickboxing as her hobbies.[127][128] She supports Scottish football team Dunfermline Athletic.[129] On 23 October 2015, Davidson became the first female Scottish politician to appear as a panellist on the BBC One satirical news quiz Have I Got News for You.[130] In 2017, Davidson became Honorary Colonel of 32nd Signal Regiment.[131] Davidson was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.[132][133]

One of his moves would have been to confer a peerage on the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, and make her defence secretary, sitting in the House of Lords. The aim was to help to position her to be Cameron's chosen successor. At some point between then and Cameron's departure, the plan went, Davidson would... renounce her peerage, and be fast-tracked into a safe Commons seat.

Personal detailsBornRuth Bernadette Finnie1976 (age 47–48)Inverness, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyParentJohn Finnie (father)Websiteruthmaguire.scotRuth Bernadette Maguire is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Cunninghame South since the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.[1]Maguire was elected as a councillor for North Ayrshire Council in 2012, in the Irvine West ward.[2] Alongside this role, Maguire was North Ayrshire Youth Champion, chaired the Violence against women partnership and served as Cabinet Member of Finance within the SNP admin.
On 5 May 2016, Ruth was elected to represent Cunninghame South within the Scottish Parliament. She resigned as a councillor following her election to parliament. Maguire was re-elected in 2021 to continue representing Cunninghame South.[3] 
Maguire is currently a part of committees for Education, Children and Young People and Local Government, Housing and Planning.[4] She has also previously been on committees for; Local Government, Social Security, and Education and Skills.
Maguire is also a Co-convener for the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on Commercial Sexual Exploitation alongside being a member of the cross-party group on Nuclear Disarmament.
In April 2019, claiming it could change what it means to be male and female, Maguire was one of 15 SNP politicians who signed a public letter calling on the Scottish Government to delay reform to the Gender Recognition Act.[5] Maguire was also the focus of a twitter storm and was called on to resign as convenor of Holyrood's Equalities and Human Rights committee after an exchange between her and SNP MSPs Ash Regan and Gillian Martin was leaked. In it, Maguire responded to a tweet praising the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's 'positive feminist analysis of trans rights,' with ‘FFS’, agreed that Sturgeon was out of step with the SNP group, and questioned whether the minister in charge of the legislation, Shirley Anne Somerville, could have ignored what 'everyone' said.[6] 
Shortly before the 2021 election, Maguire was diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer.[7] After taking medical leave and successful treatment, she returned to Holyrood in December 2021.[8]

Personal detailsBornSandra Harley (1951-08-17) 17 August 1951 (age 72)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartySandra White (born 17 August 1951) is a retired Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Glasgow electoral region from 1999 until 2011, and then the MSP for the Glasgow Kelvin constituency from 2011 until she stood down from the Scottish Parliament at the May 2021 election.

Political career[edit]
White served as an SNP councillor in Renfrewshire. She contested Glasgow Kelvin in 1999, where she came second to the Labour Party candidate by 4,408 votes, but was elected to the Scottish Parliament on the Glasgow regional list. She was re-elected in 2003, topping the SNP's list of candidates for that region. Contesting Glasgow Kelvin that year she again came second to Labour, this time by the smaller margin of 3,289 votes.[1]White was re-elected on the regional list in 2007. In the 2011 election, she again contested the Glasgow Kelvin seat, this time defeating the sitting Labour MSP Pauline McNeill by 882 votes. White served as an SNP Parliamentary group whip in the first parliamentary session and sat on the parliament's Public Petitions Committee and Equal Opportunities Committee.[2][3][4]White holds her party's Deputy Social Justice portfolio. Her campaigns include against closures and downgrading (including a 1,600 signature petition) at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill and the Queen Mother's Hospital.[2][3][4] She has also campaigned against racism[5] and for improved treatment of asylum seekers, including joining an occupation against 'dawn raids'.[6]Her other campaigns have included the successful attempts to save the 7:84 theatre group from threatened loss of funding by the Scottish Arts Council[7] and involvement in Stop the War Coalition events,[8] while high-profile constituency work has included the August 2006 case of an 86-year-old widow who was threatened with court by Glasgow Housing Association.[9]In August 2020, White announced that she would not be standing for re-election at the upcoming Holyrood election.[10]
Controversies[edit]
In November 2015 White re-tweeted an antisemitic cartoon showing piglets suckling a large pig with the word “Rothschild” written on it and showing a bank with a Star of David.[11] The tweet had originally been sent by a Twitter user who had repeatedly posted antisemitic messages and images.[11] After The Jewish Chronicle brought the tweet to the attention of the SNP, the party's spokesperson said the tweet had been re-tweeted in error, and had since been deleted.[11]
Personal life[edit]
White was born on 17 August 1951 to Elizabeth Rodgers and Henry Harley. She married David White in 1971, and has two sons and one daughter. Her interests outside politics are walking, reading and gardening.[12]

   ​ ​(m. 2000; div. 2003)​Alma materUniversity of GlasgowHeriot-Watt UniversityProfessionTown plannerWebsitewww.sarahboyack.comSarah Herriot Boyack (born 16 May 1961) is a Scottish Labour politician who has served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Lothian region since 2019, and previously from 2011 to 2016. She formerly represented the Edinburgh Central constituency from 1999 to 2011.

Early life and career[edit]
Boyack was born in May 1961 in Glasgow and brought up in Edinburgh.[1][2] Her father, Jim Boyack, was an important figure in the Labour Party and the campaign for Scottish devolution.[3] She was educated at the state comprehensive Royal High School, Edinburgh, where she was one of the first female pupils.[2]Starting in 1979, Boyack studied Modern History and Politics at the University of Glasgow, graduating with a Scottish MA Honours degree.[4] She became active in the Labour club, where she was a protégé of Margaret Curran. She was chair of the Labour club from 1981 until 1982, and chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students from 1985 until 1986. During her time at Glasgow, she was involved in supporting the twinning with Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. After graduating, she gained a Diploma in Town and Country Planning at Heriot-Watt University.[4]Boyack worked as a town planner in the London Borough of Brent then as a strategic planner in Central Regional Council in Stirling.[5] She then became a lecturer at the School of Planning and Housing at Heriot-Watt University and was Convener of the Scottish Branch of the Royal Town Planning Institute in 1997.[6]
Political career[edit]
Member of the Scottish Parliament: 1999–2016[edit]
Boyack was elected to the new Scottish Parliament in the 1999 election for the Edinburgh Central constituency. She was Minister for Transport and the Environment in the Scottish Executive from 1999 until 2000. Then, she was Minister for Transport and Planning from 2000 until 2001, during which time she introduced one of Scottish Labour's flagship policies of free bus travel for people over 60 and disabled people.[2]Re-elected for her constituency in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Boyack was elected by MSPs as Convener of the Scottish Parliament Environment and Rural Development Committee in June 2003. In this role, she received the RSPB Goldcrest Award in November 2004 for the most outstanding contribution to the development of environmental policy in Scotland since devolution.[7] Later, in December 2005, she was named the Scottish Renewables Best Politician.[2] She stood down from the committee in January 2007, when she returned to the Scottish Executive as Deputy Minister for the Environment and Rural Development.[8]Boyack lost her Edinburgh Central constituency seat in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election to Marco Biagi of the Scottish National Party (SNP). However, she was elected on the Lothian regional list as one of seven additional members. Following a landslide victory by the SNP in the election, Boyack co-chaired a review of the Labour Party in Scotland with Jim Murphy, commissioned by Ed Miliband in May 2011 and which reported back in Autumn of that year.[9][10]On 28 October 2014, Boyack declared she would stand in the upcoming election to become the Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.[3][11] She came third to Jim Murphy and Neil Findlay with 9.24% of the vote.[12]She served as a member of the Parliament's Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment (RACCE) Committee during its scrutiny of the Land Reform Bill 2015. [13]
Outside the Scottish Parliament: 2016–2019[edit]
Boyack again contested the Edinburgh Central seat in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, but was defeated by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who stood for the same constituency. Boyack was also placed third on the Lothian regional list of Labour candidates behind Kezia Dugdale and Neil Findlay, but did not return to Holyrood following the election since Labour won only two list seats.[14][15]In February 2017, Boyack was appointed as Head of Public Affairs at the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, the membership body for social housing providers in Scotland.[16]
Return following Kezia Dugdale's resignation: 2019–present[edit]
On 30 April 2019, it was announced Boyack would return to the Scottish Parliament as a list MSP, following Kezia Dugdale's decision to vacate her seat in the summer. As an unsuccessful Labour candidate on the Lothian regional list in 2016, Boyack was the next person on the list if a seat was vacated.[17] In September 2019, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard appointed her as Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Local Government.[18]Boyack nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership election.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Boyack married former long-term partner Andrew Walters in December 2000. They had planned to marry in the October but postponed the wedding due to the death of Donald Dewar. The couple divorced in 2003 and they had no children together.[20]
Notes[edit]

^ Transport and the Environment (1999–2000)

^ Normally, regional MSPs do not have individual predecessors and successors. However, Dugdale retired her seat during a sitting parliament so was succeeded by Boyack.

Born in Kirkcaldy, Somerville attended the University of Strathclyde, and later the University of Stirling, earning a BA (Hons) in Economics and Politics, and a Diploma in Housing studies respectively. After graduating, she worked as a Policy and Public Affairs Officer, and in 2006 she attended Queen Margaret University.[1] In the 2007 Scottish election, she was an SNP candidate for the Edinburgh Central constituency, but failed to win the seat, coming third. Following the resignation of Stefan Tymkewycz, Somerville succeeded him as the MSP for the Lothian region. She lost her seat in the 2011 election and in 2012 was announced as a director of Yes Scotland. After losing the 2013 Dunfermline by-election, she stood down as director of communities.
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Somerville was elected to serve as the MSP for the Dunfermline constituency. She served as Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science from 2016 to 2018, before being appointed to the Scottish Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People in Nicola Sturgeon's 2018 cabinet reshuffle. Somerville was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament in the 2021 election, and in Sturgeon's third government, she was appointed Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills.[2] Following her appointment, she announced that the Scottish Qualifications Authority and Education Scotland would be reformed, following widespread criticism.[3]
Early life[edit]
Early years and education[edit]
Shirley-Anne Somerville was born on 2 September 1974 in Cardenden in Fife.[4] She was educated at Kirkcaldy High School, before attending the University of Strathclyde from 1992 to 1996, graduating with a BA (Hons) in Economics and Politics. From 1997 to 1999, Somerville attended the University of Stirling, where she gained a Diploma in Housing Studies. Before being elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2007, she attended the Queen Margaret University, where she took a Diploma in Public Relations.[1][5]
Early career[edit]
She worked as a parliamentary researcher for Duncan Hamilton, who was the MSP for Highlands and Islands. From 2001 to 2004, she was a Policy and Public Affairs Officer at the Chartered Institute of Housing, before working as a Media and Campaigns Officer at the Royal College of Nursing from 2004 to 2007.[1][5]
Early political years[edit]
Somerville joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) when she was 16.[6] As a member of the party's youth wing, she campaigned alongside Nicola Sturgeon and Shona Robison.
In the 2001 UK general election, Somerville stood as the SNP's candidate for Kirkcaldy, where she came in 2nd place with 22.2% of the vote. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, she was the candidate in the Edinburgh Central constituency, where she came in 3rd place with 25.5% of the vote.

Political career[edit]
Member of the Scottish Parliament; 2007-2011[edit]
Somerville (left), John Swinney (centre), and Michael Russell (right)On 31 August 2007, Stefan Tymkewycz resigned his seat in the Scottish Parliament representing the Lothians region in order to concentrate on serving as a City of Edinburgh councillor. Somerville was selected by the SNP to succeed him.[7] In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, she lost her seat.
Director of Yes Scotland[edit]
On the launch of the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign in 2012, Somerville was announced as its director of communities.[8]  She later stood as the SNP candidate in the Dunfermline by-election, 24th October 2013, coming second behind Cara Hilton of Scottish Labour. She did not return to her position in Yes Scotland after the by-election. She campaigned in favour of Scottish independence in the run up to the 2014 referendum.[8]
Return to Holyrood[edit]
In the Scottish Parliament election of 2016, Somerville again stood in the Dunfermline constituency. This time she was successful in securing the seat, defeating Cara Hilton on a majority of 4,558 votes.

Junior minister[edit]
In May 2016, she was appointed Minister of Further Education, Higher Education and Science.[9]
Cabinet Secretary for Social Security (2018–2021)[edit]
Somerville at Scottish Government Press Conference on COVID-19, September 2020On 26 June 2018, Sturgeon performed a cabinet reshuffle of her second cabinet. She promoted Somerville to the new cabinet level position of Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, succeeding Jeane Freeman who served as the junior minister equivalent. In February 2021, Christina McKelvie announced a short medical leave and her role was covered by Somerville as Minister for Equalities and Older People.[10]Gender recognition[edit]
See also: Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill
In early 2020, Somerville announced the government would propose to amend the Gender Recognition Act 2004 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.[11] The bill would make it easier for people to change their name legally, drop the requirement for medical evidence and lower the age limit for applications from 18 to 16. The bill has been opposed by For Women Scotland.[12][13] On an interview with STV, Somerville recognised that women's rights are exceptionally important and have been long-fought for. She emphasised her commitment not to jeopardise women's rights. Somerville hoped for the bill to be passed by the end of the 5th Scottish Parliament, however, delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic have affected this ambition.[14]
Cabinet Secretary for Education (2021–present)[edit]
In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Somerville secured a second term as the MSP for the Dunfermline constituency.[15] The SNP fell two seats short of an overall majority in the election, however, remained the largest party, with more than double the seats of the Scottish Conservatives.[16] Sturgeon announced her intention to form a third administration and appointed Somerville as the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, succeeding John Swinney, who was mounted with pressure by opposition to resign.[17][18][19][20] The general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) Larry Flanagan welcomed her appointment, but added, ""The first issue the Cabinet Secretary will need to address is an end to the scandal of temporary contracts throughout the education system."".[21]
SQA and Education Scotland reform[edit]
Somerville before the Scottish Parliament's committee on education, October 2021In June 2021, Somerville revealed plans to reform the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and Education Scotland was under way.[22] The following year exams were scrapped and the SQA was criticised for down-grading teachers predictions which were based on pupil assessments.[23] After public outcry and protests from pupils, the Scottish Government u-turned it's decision and allowed teachers predictions to be considered for pupil grading.[24][25][26] In the 2021 exam diet, exams were cancelled too, but students claimed the ""assessments"" were the equivalent to exams.[27]The OECD published a report on the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) and recommended the government considered creating a ""specialist stand-alone agency responsible for curriculum"".[28] Somerville responded: “The OECD report is crystal clear - Curriculum for Excellence is the right approach for Scotland. In fact, despite all the criticism here at home, the OECD tells us it is viewed internationally as an inspiring example of curriculum practice. However, 10 years on from CfE being introduced, it is right and proper that we review how it is being implemented."".[29]In March 2022, Somerville confirmed the SQA would be replaced by Qualifications Scotland and Education Scotland would be replaced by a new executive agency by the summer of 2024.[30]
Personal life[edit]
Somerville lives in North Queensferry with her husband and two children. She is a trustee of Shelter Scotland, and is a member of the RSPB and the Scottish Wildlife Trust.[31]

   ​ ​(mUniversity of GlasgowJordanhill CollegeWebsiteshona.robison.scotShona McRory Robison (born 26 May 1966) is a Scottish politician serving as Deputy First Minister of Scotland and Cabinet Secretary for Finance since 2023. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Dundee City East since 2003[b] and was an additional member for the North East Scotland region from 1999 to 2003.
Born in England, Robison studied at the University of Glasgow and Jordanhill College. She was an active member of the SNP's youth wing and worked in Glasgow City Council's Social Work Department, until her election to the Scottish Parliament in 1999.
Robison served as Minister for Public Health and Sport from 2007 to 2011. She then oversaw the Scottish Government's preparations for the 2014 Commonwealth Games as Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport from 2011 to April 2014, when she was promoted to the Scottish Cabinet by Alex Salmond as Cabinet Secretary for Commonwealth Games, Sport, Equalities and Pensioners' Rights.  When Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Salmond as First Minister in November 2014, she appointed Robison the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport.
In 2018, she resigned from government during a cabinet reshuffle after being widely criticised for her poorly received tenure as Heath Secretary.[3][4][5] She returned to the backbenches, where she served on the justice and health committees. In 2021, Robison returned to Sturgeon's government as the Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, Housing and Local Government. During her tenure in the position, she oversaw the government's efforts to pass the controversial Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill. Following Sturgeon's resignation as first minister in 2023, Robison was appointed Deputy First Minister and Finance Secretary by Humza Yousaf in his new government.

Early life[edit]
Shona McRory Robison was born in Redcar, North Yorkshire, England, on 26 May 1966.[6] She attended Alva Academy in Clackmannanshire.[7] She gained a Master of Arts in Social Science at the University of Glasgow in 1989. The following year, she gained a Postgraduate Cert in Community Education at Jordanhill College.[8]Robison joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1988.[9] She was an active member of the party's youth wing the Young Scottish Nationalist, now known as Young Scots for Independence, where she met the likes of Nicola Sturgeon and Fiona Hyslop.[10]Before being elected to the Scottish Parliament, she worked in Glasgow City Council's Social Work Department.[11][12]
Early parliamentary career[edit]
SNP in opposition; 1997 to 2007[edit]
Official parliamentary portrait, 1999Robison contested in the first election to the Scottish Parliament for the Dundee East constituency. Although she was unsuccessful, having came second to Scottish Labour's John McAllion, she was elected as an additional member for the North East Scotland region. In her first term, she was member of the Health and Community Care Committee and was the Deputy Convenor of the Equal Opportunities Committee.[13]She served in the SNP's opposition cabinet as the shadow deputy minister for health and community care.
In the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Robison successfully defeated McAllion by just 100 votes in Dundee East. She served as the Shadow Minister for Health and Social Justice in the SNP's opposition benches.[14] Robison was a member of the Health Committee.[11]

Junior ministerial career; 2007 to 2014[edit]
Robison with Nicola Sturgeon at am Active Nation reception in Kirkcaldy, 2011After the SNP's victory in the 2007 election, Robison was appointed as the Minister for Public Health.[15] In 2009, she added Sport onto her portfolio.[16] In the 2011 election, Robison was re-elected into the newly drawn, Dundee City East constituency. She was appointed Minister for Commonwealth Games and Sport.
In the run up to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, Robison wrote to the University of Dundee to complain that a Dundee professor had chaired an event for the Better Together campaign. Robison insisted that Christopher Whatley's involvement in the Five Million Questions project about the implications of the referendum meant he should have taken a neutral stance on the constitutional issue.[17] However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: ""I'm not sure this kind of bullying and intimidation is the best advert for the SNP's vision of a future separate Scotland. In fact, it is chilling.""[18]In April 2014, Alex Salmond promoted her to the full Cabinet position of Cabinet Secretary for Commonwealth Games, Sport, Equalities and Pensioners' Rights.

Health Secretary; 2014 to 2018[edit]
Robison speaking at the Parliament of Canada, 2014On 21 November 2014, Robison was appointed by Sturgeon as Cabinet Secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Sport, in Sturgeon's first government. Following the 2016 election, she was reappointed into Sturgeon's cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport.[19] In January 2018, during an appearance at Holyrood's Health and Sport Committee, she was warned by Labour MSP Neil Findlay of a ""drugs disaster"".[20] In 2018, Scotland went on to record the highest number of drug deaths per head in the European Union, at a rate nearly three times higher than the UK average.[21]On 26 June 2018, she announced her intention to resign from Cabinet. Shortly after a cabinet reshuffle was made by Sturgeon.[22] BBC political correspondent Glenn Campbell wrote after the reshuffle: ""The most widely anticipated departure was t/hat of health secretary, Shona Robison. She's been under considerable pressure over NHS performance. She stood down on the day the Scottish government confirmed its worst cancer waiting times for six years.""[3]
Backbencher; 2018 to 2021[edit]
Following her resignation from government, Robison returned to the backbenches. She served on the Parliament's Justice Committee and Social Security Committee. Amid the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, she served as a member of the COVID-19 Committee.
In February 2021, Audit Scotland published a report that concluded the Scottish Government had not prepared adequately for a pandemic. The watchdog also noted that recommendations from pandemic planning exercises during Robison's time as Health Secretary had not been fully implemented. One particular failure it highlighted was that not enough had been done to ensure Scottish hospitals and care homes had enough personal protective equipment (PPE). Overall, it concluded that ministers ""could have been better prepared to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic"". Nicola Sturgeon said there were ""lots of lessons to learn"".[23][24]
Social Justice Secretary; 2021 to 2023[edit]
See also: Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill
Official portrait as Social Justice Secretary, 2021On 20 May 2021, Sturgeon announced her third government, with Robison returning as Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, Housing and Local Government. Robison held the position of Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice until the election of Humza Yousaf as First Minister in March 2023. Following a cabinet reshuffle, Yousaf appointed Shirley-Anne Somerville as Robison's replacement and promoted Robison to Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Finance.
During Robison's tenure in the Social Justice department, she oversaw the implementation of the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill which was received with backlash from many fearing it was jeopardising the safety of women. Robison reassured MSPs and the public that the bill did ""not conflict with work to advance women's rights and equality"" and that she was ""conscious that some of the details of the proposed reforms have become lost within the wider discussions around trans rights and the perceived conflict with the rights of women and girls"".[25] The bill intended to introduce a process of self-declaration for transgender people, allowing them to obtain a gender recognition certificate (GRC), thus removing the need for a psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria before being allowed to change their gender legally.[25] In December 2022, 150 amendments had been put forward to the Scottish Parliament regarding the bill which saw MSPs sit and debate the bill in the Scottish Parliament chamber long into the evening.[26] Robison wrote to three individual MSPs claiming that their amendments put the bill ""at serious risk"".[26]The bill was blocked by the UK Government, with Robison stating that she would ""vigorously contest"" any attempt by the UK Government to block the gender reform legislations which the Scottish Parliament has control over.[27] Under Section 35 of the Scotland Act 1998, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak blocked the implementation of the gender reform bill. This marked the first time that the UK Government had blocked a piece of legislation from being passed since devolution.[28]

Robison issued a statement through an interview with The Telegraph on the issue, stating that the hospital would not be downgraded or lose its casualty department, citing the fact that the Emergency Department at Inverclyde Royal Hospital was ""one of the best performing A&E's in Scotland, certainly within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.[32] Robison committed further money for improvements to both NHS Scotland services and facilities, citing proposals set out to be met by 2026.[32]
Cabinet Secretary for Finance[edit]
Robison said that her immediate priorities as Finance Secretary was ""more efficient public services and fair work"" being at the heart of the Economy of Scotland. In April 2023, Robison launched the Scottish Government's Portfolio Prospectus which sets out a number of economic actions to be achieved by 2026. These include proposals for creating the UK's most progressive tax system to assist in the delivery of Scottish public services, new opportunities to tackle poverty and measures to grow the wellbeing economy whilst increasing the number of employees earning the real living wage, while narrowing the gender pay gap. Additionally, the Scottish Government has an ambition of spearheading Scotland as a leading European start-up nation for the creation of new businesses as well as developing Scotland's existing international exports while developing into new international trading market. Robison also recognising the importance of re-developing Scotland's infrastructure and economy to allow it to be more sustainable in the future, with plans for laying foundations to produce 5 Gigawatts (GW) of hydrogen production by 2030, as part of a Scottish hydrogen supply chain. As Finance Secretary, Robison will commit to implementing a ""New Deal"" for Scottish local authorities.[33]Robison delivered her first Medium–Term Financial Strategy to the Scottish Parliament in May 2023.[34] Robison highlighted the importance of ""sound public finances"" being ""key to ensuring we can tackle poverty and build a fair, green and growing economy whilst improving our public services"".[34] Robison claimed that the current economic situation in Scotland had ""been amongst the most challenging since devolution"", citing global issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and soaring inflation being driving factors directly impacting the Scottish economy.[34] Robison was also critical of UK Government policy and decision making that had impacted on Scotland, including Brexit and its association economic impact, ""a decade of austerity"" and the September 2022 United Kingdom mini-budget.[34]
Personal life[edit]
She was married to Stewart Hosie,[35] who is the Westminster MP for Dundee East and was previously the SNP's Depute Leader. They have one daughter. Robison experienced a miscarriage in 2007.[36] It was announced on 15 May 2016 that the couple had separated.[37] This was followed by reports that Hosie had had an affair with Westminster-based freelance journalist Serena Cowdy.[38]

Personal detailsBornSiobhan Marie McMahon (1984-07-04) 4 July 1984 (age 39)Lanarkshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourSpouseJohn WrightChildren1 daughterAlma materGlasgow Caledonian UniversitySiobhan Marie McMahon (born 4 July 1984) is a Scottish Labour Party politician who served as a regional list Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Central Scotland region from 2011 to 2016.

Education and early career[edit]
McMahon graduated from Glasgow Caledonian University in 2006 with a 2.1 BA Honours degree in Politics with History and Sociology. She worked as a paid researcher for her father, the serving Hamilton North and Bellshill MSP Michael McMahon, who also employed her mother as a paid assistant.[1]
Member of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, McMahon was elected as a regional list MSP, and her father and herself became the first father-and-daughter pair to serve in the Scottish Parliament.[2]McMahon was involved in Johann Lamont's successful campaign in the 2011 Scottish Labour Party leadership election. Following Lamont's victory, McMahon became her Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS), with the right to attend meetings of the Scottish Labour Shadow Cabinet.[3]McMahon was one of three Labour MSPs that voted against the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, which legislated on civil and religious same-sex marriage.[4]Following Johann Lamont's resignation as leader following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, McMahon supported Jim Murphy in the 2014 Scottish Labour Party leadership election, and afterwards he gave her a junior role as Shadow Minister for Youth and Women’s Employment, reporting to Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Fair Work, Skills and Training Neil Findlay.[5]McMahon endorsed Richard Baker, then subsequently Ken Macintosh in the 2015 Scottish Labour Party leadership election. After Macintosh ultimately lost to Kezia Dugdale, McMahon lost her frontbench post in Dugdale's first reshuffle.
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, McMahon was succeeded as first on the Central Scotland regional list by Richard Leonard, who became Leader of the Scottish Labour Party following the 2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election.[6][7] McMahon was ranked tenth by Labour Party members onto the Labour regional list; as only seven MSPs are elected from the list it was impossible for her to be elected again.[8]In the 2016 election, McMahon's father lost his Uddingston and Bellshill seat after serving as an MSP since 1999 and she criticised Kezia Dugdale for failing to send condolences to defeated MSPs like her father. In response, Dugdale invited all non-returning, including regional list, MSPs to a dinner she would be hosting the following week.[9]
Personal life[edit]
McMahon is married to John Wright, with whom she has one daughter, Anna. McMahon now works in civil society. She suffers from a disability called hemiplegia, a neuromuscular condition which causes weakness along the right-hand side of her body.[10] She is a Christian.[11]

Personal detailsBornStephen Charles Kerr (1960-09-26) 26 September 1960 (age 63)Dundee, ScotlandPolitical partyConservativeSpouseYvonne KerrChildren4Alma materUniversity of StirlingStephen Charles Kerr (born 26 September 1960) is a Scottish politician serving as convener of the Education, Children and Young People Committee since 2021. A member of the Scottish Conservatives, he has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Central Scotland region since 2021. He was previously Member of Parliament (MP) for Stirling from 2017 to 2019.
Kerr attended the University of Stirling and worked for Kimberly Clark before his election to Parliament. He was the Conservative candidate in Stirling in 2005 and 2015 but was defeated by Labour and the SNP, respectively. He eventually gained the seat in 2017 with a narrow majority over Steven Paterson. However, he was defeated by Alyn Smith in 2019.
Listed number one on the Scottish Conservative Central Scotland regional list, Kerr was elected at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election.

Early life and career[edit]
Kerr was born in Dundee[1][2] and raised on a council estate in Forfar, Angus. He attended a local primary school and later, Forfar Academy, before leaving at 16 to work as a bank junior. He graduated from the University of Stirling with an honours degree in business.[3] Kerr's career has largely been spent working in business, mainly in sales and marketing. His role immediately prior to his election involved heading the sales teams for Kimberly Clark in the UK, Ireland and France.[4]
Member of Parliament for Stirling[edit]
Kerr was the Conservative Party candidate in Stirling at both the 2005 and 2015 general elections; where he lost to Labour the first time, and the SNP the second time[5] before he eventually gained the seat in 2017 with a narrow majority of 148 votes (0.3%) over Steven Paterson of the SNP.[6]Kerr signed a letter to the Prime Minister on 16 February 2018, making suggestions about the way Britain should leave the European Union.[7]Kerr founded the APPG for Professional Sales as Chairman, in June 2018. It published a report into the sales capabilities of SMEs in October 2019, making 24 recommendations on how to help SMEs to improve their sales capabilities. The launch event was keynoted by Kelly Tolhurst, Small Businesses Minister.
In July 2018, Kerr unveiled replicas of the John Allan Stones at the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum. The stones were originally placed on Albany Crescent, a now-demolished row of houses near the Stirling City Centre. Although the original stones were taken to the United States by David O. McKay, who had seen them while serving as a Mormon missionary, following the houses being knocked down, they remained a part of Stirling's history through their association with Stirling architect John Allan. The motto ""What e're thou art, act well thy part"" inscribed on the stones inspired McKay to continue his work as a missionary, and as such became known across the Church for their inspiring qualities. The originals can still be found in the church's Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.[8] The replica stones were carved by Doune Stonemasons James Innes and Son.[9]Kerr was defeated by the SNP's Alyn Smith in the 2019 general election. Smith won the seat from Kerr with a majority of 9,254 votes (17.6%).[10]
Member of the Scottish Parliament for Central Scotland[edit]
Kerr topped the Scottish Conservative list for Central Scotland in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. He was elected alongside Graham Simpson and Meghan Gallacher. He took his seat on 10 May 2021.[11] Upon his election, he was given the role of Chief Whip for the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood, replacing Miles Briggs.[12]On the 28 May, Kerr used his maiden speech to urge the Cabinet Secretary for Health, Humza Yousaf, to speed up rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.[13] He was later elected as convenor of the Education, Skills and Young People committee on 23 June.[14]On 12 January 2022, Kerr called for Boris Johnson to resign as Conservative party leader and Prime Minister over the Westminster lockdown parties controversy along with a majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs.[15]In a mini-reshuffle in September 2022, Kerr was moved to be the Shadow Secretary for Education and Skills, shadowing Shirley-Anne Somerville. He was replaced as Scottish Conservative Chief Whip by Alexander Burnett. [16]In January 2023, Kerr wrote an article for the Daily Telegraph calling on reforms of the Scottish Parliament to offer greater scrutiny of the Scottish Government, arguing that Holyrood proceedings were ""rigorously controlled"" by Scottish Ministers and accused SNP backbenchers of ""scripted questions"".[17] Kerr's article sparked debate across Scotland, with Kerr's arguments being supported by former SNP Government ministers. [18]Kerr caused controversy on 14 April 2023 in a now deleted tweet when he suggested transgender people have learning disabilities and has since apologised.[19]Since becoming the Shadow Secretary for Education and Skills, Kerr has called for many reforms within Scottish Education, including a new deal for teachers.[20] Kerr has highlighted the rise in violent attacks in the classroom, successfully persuading the Government to hold a national discussion to address this problem.[21]
Personal life[edit]
Kerr has lived in the Stirling area since 1982.[3] He and his wife, Yvonne, were married in 1983 and they are the parents of four children. They have lived in Bridge of Allan since the 1980s.[22] He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and has served in a number of positions in the church, including as a missionary in London during his youth and an area seventy from 2006 to 2013.[23][24] Among other assignments while an area seventy, Kerr was president of the Church's first pageant held in Britain.[25]

Personal detailsBorn (1963-12-24) 24 December 1963 (age 60)Glasgow, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyOther politicalaffiliationsLabour (until 1988)Alma materGlasgow College of TechnologyWilliam Stewart Maxwell (born 24 December 1963) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician.  He was the Minister for Communities and Sport from 2007 to 2009 and a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland region from 2003 to 2016.

Early life[edit]
Maxwell was born on 24 December 1963 in Glasgow, Scotland. Maxwell attended Kings Park Secondary School before graduating from Glasgow College of Technology with a BA Honours Social Sciences. He worked for Strathclyde Fire Brigade between 1993 and 2003 before being elected.

Political career[edit]
He stood as the SNP candidate in the 2003 election and was elected by the regional list.[1]After his election in 2003, Stewart Maxwell became the Deputy Convener of the Parliament's Justice 1 Committee and a member of the Subordinate Legislation Committee. He transferred from Justice 1 to Justice 2 Committee in 2004 and was also appointed to the post of SNP spokesperson on Public Health and the Shadow Deputy Minister for Health. In September 2006 he was promoted to the SNP's Shadow Cabinet when he became the Party Spokesperson for Sport and Culture.[2] At the end of 2006 he moved from the Justice 2 Committee to the Parliament's Enterprise and Culture Committee and remained on the Subordinate Legislation Committee. After the SNP's victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, he became the Minister for Communities and Sport.  However, he returned to the backbenches in the SNP Ministerial reshuffle on 10 February 2009.[3] After leaving Ministerial office he became one of two representatives from the Scottish Parliament on the European Committee of the Regions and became a member of the Parliament's Justice Committee. After the 2011 election he was appointed to the post of Convener of the Education and Culture Committee and as one of the SNP members of the Scotland bill Committee.
Stewart Maxwell is best known for being the architect of the ban on smoking in enclosed places in Scotland. He laid a motion in the Scottish Parliament stating that he intended to bring forward a bill to ban smoking in public places in July 2003 and went on to introduce the Bill to ban tobacco smoking in enclosed public places in February 2004.[4] The Scottish Executive at first opposed this proposal, but were eventually forced to accept the idea after it received widespread support. They eventually published their own bill which was passed on 30 June 2005 and the ban came into effect on 26 March 2006.
For the last few years he has also been campaigning on knife crime and has made various proposals to tackle this issue in Scotland, including the mandatory reporting of knife attacks by hospitals to the police and the use of hand-held metal detectors at the doors of some pubs and clubs. He successfully moved an amendment to the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice Bill which doubled the maximum sentence for carrying a knife in public.
He was a member of the SNPs National Executive Committee as well as serving as the Vice Convenor in charge of Publicity during 2003–2004. During the 2003–2007 session of Parliament he was a member of six Parliamentary cross party groups; Tobacco Control, Sport, Contemporary Scottish Music Industry, Culture and Media, Cancer and Food. He is currently a member of the following CPGs: Tobacco Control, Veterans, Golf and Universities and Colleges.
The SNP hold a 'One Member One Vote' ballot of all Party members to determine the order of their candidates on the regional lists for the Scottish Parliament elections. Stewart Maxwell, who was third on the SNP list for the West of Scotland in 2003, was elected to first place on the SNP list for 2007 and topped the list again in 2011.
In November 2006 he was made Honorary Vice-President of the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland for his work on the introduction of the ban on smoking in public places.
Ahead of the 2016 elections, Maxwell was confirmed as the SNP's candidate for the Eastwood constituency in July 2015.[5][6] In October it was announced that he would be second on the SNP's list of candidates for West Scotland.[7] In a close contest, Conservative Jackson Carlaw won the seat and Labour's Ken Macintosh was pushed into third.[8] Maxwell was not re-elected.

Armed Forces Legal Action[edit]
Maxwell was appointed as an honorary patron of Armed Forces Legal Action (AFLA) in April 2014. AFLA is a network of law firms committed to offering discounted legal services to members of the UK Armed Forces community. AFLA was founded by Scottish solicitor Allan Steele WS, who stood against Maxwell as the Scottish Liberal Democrat candidate in the Westminster Parliamentary election of 2001 and the Holyrood Parliamentary election of 2003.[9]He is married with one daughter.

A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, formerly Banff and Buchan, from 2001 to 2021.[1]
Early life[edit]
Stevenson was born in Edinburgh. His father James Stevenson was a doctor and his mother Helen MacGregor was a teacher.[2] He was brought up in Cupar, Fife. He was educated at Bell Baxter High School then studied mathematics at the University of Aberdeen.[3] He worked in information technology with the Bank of Scotland for 30 years,[3] retiring in 1999 as Director of Technology Innovation.[4]
Political career[edit]
In Opposition[edit]
Stevenson joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1961. He stood as an SNP candidate in the Linlithgow constituency in the 1999 Scottish General election but was unsuccessful.[5]In January 2001 Stevenson was adopted as the candidate for Banff and Buchan, ahead of the by-election on 7 June 2001 that was triggered by Alex Salmond's resignation from the seat to concentrate on Westminster politics.[6] Stevenson was elected with a majority of 8,500 votes over the Conservative candidate.[7]He made his maiden speech on the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy on 14 June 2001.[8]He was re-elected to the constituency in the 2003 elections.[9]
University Challenge[edit]
In 2004 he was a member of the Scottish Parliament team in the TV general knowledge programme, University Challenge – The Professionals. He and fellow team members Richard Baker (Labour), Robin Harper (Green), Jamie Stone (Lib Dem) who was captain, beat a Welsh Assembly team by 110 points to 75.[10][11][12]
Responsibilities[edit]
In opposition he was Deputy Party Spokesperson on Health until September 2004, then becoming Deputy Party Spokesperson on Justice[13] with responsibility for Prisons and Drugs policy. He was Convenor of the SNP Group in the Scottish Parliament and Deputy Convenor of the Parliament's Justice 1 Committee.[14] In addition he ended Session 2 as a substitute member of the Parliament's Health Committee[15] and Deputy Convenor of the Parliament's Cross Party Group on Visual Impairment.[citation needed]
Records[edit]
By the end of Parliament's second session on 2 April 2007 he had made 284 speeches in the Scottish Parliament and was thus the most prolific speaker since the Parliament's being re-convened in 1999. By the end of Session 3 in March 2011, he had made 406 speeches and retained the position of ""most prolific parliamentary speaker"". He reached his 500th speech[16] on the Tribunals (Scotland) Bill, on 7 November 2013.[17]He can, arguably, hold the record for the longest speech in Parliament. He commenced a speech on International Suicide Prevention Week at 17:21 on Wednesday, 7 September 2004[18] and completed it at 17:12 on Thursday, 8 September 2004[19] nearly 24 hours later. However this was due to the failure of the Parliament's sound system just after he started to speak.[20]On 12 June 2015, he became the first Member of the Scottish Parliament to have made 600 speeches.[21]
In Government[edit]
In the 2007 Scottish General election on 3 May, he was returned with a majority of 10,530, the largest in Scotland, over the Scottish Conservative Party candidate.[22] The SNP formed a minority government and on 17 May Stevenson was appointed the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change.[23] This appointment covered: the land use planning system, climate change, building standards, transport policy and delivery, public transport, road, rail services, canals, harbours, air and ferry services, Scottish Water.[citation needed]As Minister, Stevenson piloted the SNP Government's first Bill, Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill.,[24] which received royal assent on 24 January 2008, becoming the Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Act 2008.[25] At the end of May the Scottish Executive approved The Port of Cairnryan Harbour Empowerment Order 2007[26][27] and with this Stevenson became the first SNP Minister to sign a piece of legislation. He also brought forward the SNP's first Legislative Consent Motion, previously known as Sewel Motions, on the subject of the UK Climate Change Bill.[28] He was also the first SNP Minister to lose a vote in Parliament on the subject of the Edinburgh Trams project.[29]As the Minister for Transport, he was involved with the progressing the legislation for the Forth Replacement Crossing, continuing a family association with Firth of Forth infrastructure projects.[30] His great uncle, Sir Alexander Stevenson, was Chairman of the Forth Road Bridge Campaign Committee in the 1930s;[31] the Forth Road Bridge opened in 1964.[32]In March 2009 Stevenson apologised for the use of an ""intemperate word"" in Parliament when he said the word ""bollocks"" in an off-mic remark in response to sedentary remarks by Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles on the relationship between Scottish ministers and officials at Transport Scotland.[33]After an unusually heavy snowfall in December 2010 caught authorities by surprise and left thousands of motorists stranded overnight on major highways, Stevenson called the government's response ""first class"" and refused to apologise; anger over the lack of preparedness and over his initial response made his position untenable, and he resigned on 11 December.[34][35]
2011 Scottish Parliament election[edit]
In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, under the re-drawn constituency boundaries, Stevenson was elected as the SNP member for the new seat of Banffshire and Buchan Coast; 16,812 votes cast for him was 67.24% of the total, the highest share of votes cast out of all the constituency elections for the Scottish Parliament in 2011.[36]Under the Second Salmond government Stevenson returned to a ministerial position, appointed as Minister for Environment and Climate Change on 20 May 2011.[37] His ministerial role ended with the re-shuffle announced on 5 September 2012, when he was replaced as Minister by Paul Wheelhouse MSP.[38]
2016 Scottish Parliament election[edit]
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Stevenson was re-elected as member for Banffshire and Buchan Coast at the 2016 election with a reduced majority of 6,583.[39]
2021 Scottish Parliament election[edit]
Stevenson did not stand for election in 2021, having previously announced his retirement.[40]Karen Adam was elected as his successor with a majority of 772.[41]Stevenson was elected National Secretary of the SNP on 30 November 2020 and served for a year.[42]In October 2022, Stevenson returned to University to study for an MSc in Genealogical, Palaeographic and Heraldic Studies at the University of Strathclyde.

Personal detailsBorn (1972-05-06) 6 May 1972 (age 51)Barrow in Furness, EnglandPolitical partyScottish National PartyAlma materAbertay UniversityWebsiteOfficial websiteStuart McMillan (born 6 May 1972) is a Scottish politician serving as Convener of the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee since 2021.[1] A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he has been the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Greenock and Inverclyde since 2016, having previously represented the West of Scotland region from 2007 to 2016.

Early life[edit]
Stuart McMillan was born in Barrow in Furness in Cumbria, England, on 6 May 1972.[2][3] He moved to Inverclyde when he was a child, where he attended Port Glasgow High School.[2] After attending Central College of Commerce, Glasgow, he studied at the University of Abertay in Dundee where he graduated with a BA (Hons) in European Business Management with Languages and latterly a MBA.[3] Once graduated he worked for IBM before working for Scottish National Party central office in Westminster. Before being elected in 2007, he was office manager to Scottish National Party Member of the Scottish Parliament Bruce McFee.

Parliamentary career[edit]
In 2007 Scottish Parliament election he stood as the SNP candidate for Greenock and Inverclyde constituency, beaten by Labour's Duncan McNeil[4] but was then elected on the regional list for the West of Scotland region.[5] He contested the seat again in the 2011 election which McNeil won with a majority of 511 and McMillan also returned to parliament through the regional list.  Stuart was elected as the MSP for Greenock & Inverclyde on 5 May 2016 with a 53.7% vote share and a majority of 8,230, becoming the first SNP member to win this constituency at the Scottish Parliament.[6]During his time as an MSP, Stuart has led campaigns on a number of issues in Inverclyde including a campaign to reduce the price of fuel in the area, improving the trunk road network, increasing marine tourism and tackling drug misuse. He has also been very vocal in his support for action to be taken against the rise of fixed-odds betting terminals, securing a victory in 2018 when the UK Government finally agreed to limit the maximum stake to £2.[7] In 2014, McMillan led a Members' Debate in the Scottish Parliament calling on the Scottish and Westminster Government's to take action on, what he described as ""cash cows"" for bookmakers.[8] He has also lobbied the Scottish Government for money to support flood prevention measures in Inverclyde.
At McMillan's request, Inverclyde Council agreed to invite former gamblers into secondary schools to speak to pupils about the dangers of gambling.[9] In 2014, McMillan also led a Members' Debate in the Scottish Parliament on the increasing reliance of food banks in Scotland. He was the first MSP to raise the issue in the Scottish Parliament and continues to work with and support the local foodbanks.[10]At present, Stuart is the Deputy Convener of the Scottish Parliament's Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee and is also a member of the COVID-19 Committee and also Convenes the Cross-Party Groups on Tourism, Visual Impairment and Recreational Boating and Marine Tourism.[11] Stuart is also the Scottish Parliament's Parliamentary Piper and plays the pipes at official functions for the Parliament. In 2017, Stuart toured the country and played the pipes at all 42 senior football grounds in Scotland raising money for charity.[12]Stuart is a lifetime honorary member of Action on Asbestos and is currently taking forward a Member's Bill to recovery the NHS the medical costs relating to industrial disease.[13] On 3 May 2015 he was elected to the board of Moving on Inverclyde, a charity which supports recovery from problematic substance use (drugs and alcohol).[14]In November 2020, McMillan condemned Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie for claims of ""anti-English rhetoric"" by the SNP during the COVID-19 pandemic. McMillan, who was born in Cumbria, said: ""As an English Scot I'd like to put on record my anger and disgust at the comments from Willie Rennie at the weekend. In his appalling attempt to bring naked constitutional politics into COVID-19 was ill-befitting of any party leader in this chamber. I'm sure that Willie Rennie will not have found the FM or any SNP politician spouting the rubbish that he claimed at the weekend. I quote from Mr Rennie: 'Anti-English rhetoric has reared its ugly head at different points throughout this crisis and there is no place for it.'
Just as he is not responsible for the comments of his supporters, there is no party leader in this parliament that is responsible for the people who support them. Similarly, no party leader is responsible for people who are not members of their party in supporting their particular cause.""[15]

Deacon's early career was in local government where she worked for seven years in research and management roles. After a spell in management consultancy and training in the private sector, she became director of MBA programmes at the Edinburgh Business School, at Heriot-Watt University, which included managing Scotland's first Consortium MBA programme for companies. Deacon was involved in the creation of the Business School as a new graduate school within the university.
Meanwhile, she rose through Labour ranks serving on the Scottish Labour Party's National Executive and was a founder member of the pro-devolution pressure group, Scottish Labour Action.

Member of Scottish Parliament[edit]
Deacon was elected to the Scottish Parliament as MSP for Edinburgh East and Musselburgh in May 1999 and, though widely tipped for ministerial office, her appointment by First Minister Donald Dewar as Scotland’s first cabinet Minister for Health and Community Care came as a surprise to many.[2] She had been education spokesperson in Dewar's election campaign team and  had been initially rejected as a candidate by Scottish Labour's controversial vetting process,[3] eventually becoming the only person to appeal successfully. Despite this rocky start, Deacon  gained respect in the new Parliament and was regarded as one of Labour's most effective performers  – and was tipped as a possible future First Minister.[4] In 1999, she won Frontbencher of the Year in the Herald's inaugural Scottish Politician of the Year Awards, and was nominated alongside Donald Dewar and Alex Salmond for that year's Scottish Politician of the Year accolade.
Henry McLeish reappointed Deacon as Health Minister when he took over as First Minister following the death of Donald Dewar in November 2000 and she continued until McLeish’s resignation in November 2001. Deacon was offered a further Cabinet position by incoming First Minister Jack McConnell in November 2001 but, by then pregnant with her second child, decided instead to leave Government[5] and go to the backbenches.
During her time as Health Minister, Deacon led major changes in the governance and leadership of the National Health Service in Scotland and championed reforms in child health, mental health and older people's care. She was responsible for the first Scottish Health Plan.[6]A critic of the flagship policy of free personal care, she argued against its introduction saying future costs were unknown and may not be sustainable – a view rejected by the Scottish Parliament. She won plaudits for her strong stance against militant anti-abortion campaigners,[7] though was criticised by the Roman Catholic Church for her position on issues such as teenage pregnancy and contraception.[8]As a backbench MSP, Deacon was regarded as a thoughtful and independent voice, served on several Parliamentary Committees, including Enterprise and Audit.  She co-founded and chaired the Cross Party Group on Sexual Health and was involved in work on reproductive health and HIV/Aids both in the UK and abroad. The only Scottish member of the RSA UK Commission on Illegal Drugs, Communities and Public Policy,[9] Deacon was a critic of Government drugs policy. Her opposition to the Iraq War won her support among Labour Party members and the Scottish public, but left relationships strained with parliamentary colleagues.[10][11] Deacon was re-elected as an MSP in 2003, securing the largest Labour majority in Edinburgh, and had been selected to fight her Edinburgh East and Musselburgh seat again in the 2007 election but in August 2006, she announced her decision to stand down from the Scottish Parliament.[12] Deacon said she had had enough of the ‘raw tribalism of party politics’ and that she wanted to 'move on to seek new challenges and to channel my energies in other ways.' [13]
Career after Parliament[edit]
Deacon stood down from the Scottish Parliament in 2007, later leaving the Labour Party, while continuing to be engaged in wider public policy debate as an independent commentator. She has spoken widely on strategic leadership and change, arguing for greater co-operation across political and sectoral boundaries and less reliance on 'top-down policies'.[14]Since leaving politics, Deacon has held a portfolio of roles in higher education, business, the public and third sectors and has contributed to a range of governance and policy reviews in various areas of public life.  She was Professor of Social Change at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh[15] from 2007–2010 and, in 2010, became an Honorary Professor in the School of Social and Political Science, at the University of Edinburgh. She was Assistant Principal External Relations at the University of Edinburgh from 2012–2018 which involved developing the university's relationships with external stakeholders and encouraging greater collaboration between academia, policymakers and business.
In 2010, Deacon was appointed by Michael Russell, MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning as the Scottish Government's ""Early Years Champion"".[16] Her report, Joining the Dots,[17] received widespread interest [18] and is credited with influencing policy and investment in children's early years development and education.
Deacon became involved with the global energy group, Iberdrola, following its acquisition of ScottishPower Ltd in 2007, serving first on the company's UK Advisory Board and then as a non-executive director and Chairman of ScottishPower Renewables Ltd. She was a non-executive director of ScottishPower Ltd from 2012–2017 [19] and from 2009 until 2014 was a trustee of Fundación Iberdrola,[20] the Spanish group's global educational and charitable arm.
Deacon has served on a number of other boards and advisory groups, including the Traverse Theatre, Pfizer UK Foundation, the Institute of Occupational Medicine, Dewar Arts Awards Trust, and the strategic review of the National Trust for Scotland. From 2008–2012, she was founding Chairperson of the Hibernian Community Foundation – the charity set up by Hibernian Football Club and, from 2015–2018, was Chair of the Institute of Directors Scotland, the first woman to hold the position.[21] She is a non-Executive director of Lothian Buses Ltd, Chair of the Edinburgh Festivals Forum and a Professional Fellow and Advisor with the University of Edinburgh, and serves, in a personal capacity, as a Member of the Secretary of State for Scotland's Scottish Business Task Force. She is a fellow of the RSA and in 2017 was made a Companion of the chartered Management Institute.
Deacon was appointed first female Chair of the Scottish Police Authority and took up this position on 4 December 2017.

Scottish Police Authority[edit]
In 2017, the Scottish Government announced Deacon's appointment as Chair of the Scottish Police Authority,[22] the national body charged with oversight of Police Scotland, the UK's second largest police service. The third person to hold the position since the creation of a unified police service for Scotland in 2012. Deacon's appointment was widely welcomed, coming as it did on the back of significant criticism of the body and its previous Chair. Deacon signalled a series of early changes in the Authority including a more transparent and outward facing approach [23] and the appointment of a number of new Board members.[24]Since becoming Chair, Deacon has presided over a number of changes in the leadership of Police Scotland. The previous Chief Constable Phil Gormley resigned in February 2017 and a number of new senior officers have since been appointed to the leadership team.[25] It is anticipated that a new Chief Constable will be announced in August 2018.
In 2019, Deacon resigned from her position as Chair of the Scottish Police Authority. She noted that ""the governance and accountability arrangements for policing in Scotland are fundamentally flawed, in structure, culture and practice"". She suggested that in order to resolve these problems the Scottish government needs to consider how policing is scrutinised in Scotland and if, perhaps, there needs to be a better separation of politics and policing. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon rejected Deacon's claims and said that the SPA would continue to make improvements.[26]
Awards and honours[edit]
Deacon was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to business, education, and public service.[27]
Personal life[edit]
Deacon lives in Prestonpans, East Lothian with her husband John Boothman and their two children.[28]

Personal detailsBorn (1966-05-06) 6 May 1966 (age 57)Inverness, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish Liberal DemocratsAlma materNapier College, EdinburghWebsiteTavish ScottTavish Hamilton Scott (born 6 May 1966) is a former Scottish politician.  He was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Shetland from 1999 to 2019, and Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats from 2008 to 2011. He stepped down as Leader after the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, in which the Liberal Democrats were reduced to five seats, down from 16 in the previous parliament.[2]
Background, education and early career[edit]
Scott was born on 6 May 1966 in Inverness, Scotland. He attended Anderson High School in  Lerwick, Shetland, and holds a BA (Hons) in Business Studies from Napier College in Edinburgh. After graduating, he worked as a parliamentary assistant to Jim Wallace, then as Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, and later as a Press Officer for the Scottish Liberal Democrats. He then returned to Shetland and became a farmer and also a councillor on the Shetland Islands Council and Chairman of the Lerwick Harbour Trust.[3]

He served as a Deputy Minister for Parliament in the Scottish Executive from 2000 to 2001 in succession to his colleague Iain Smith, but resigned after refusing to support the Executive in a vote on a tie-up scheme for fishing.
In 2003, he returned to the Scottish Executive as Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services.  During his time there his department piloted the Local Governance (Scotland) Act, which changed the elections for local authorities in Scotland to a proportional representation system.  Following Nicol Stephen's election as party leader and succession as Deputy First Minister of Scotland in 2005, Scott was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Transport. He was re-elected with an increased majority in May 2007,[5] and held the largest margin by percentage, 50.1%, of any MSP over their closest challenger.
After the resignation of his friend and former ministerial colleague Nicol Stephen, Scott declared his candidacy for the leadership of the Scottish Liberal Democrats on 7 July 2008 at Lerwick harbour, surrounded by a group of men dressed as Vikings.[6]  On 26 August 2008, he was announced the winner of the leadership contest with 59% (1,450) of the votes.[7]Following what he described as a ""disastrous"" set of results for the Scottish Liberal Democrats in the Scottish elections in May 2011, Scott offered his resignation as leader (remaining a Member of the Scottish Parliament).[8] He claimed the poor showings were in part due to the coalition deal which saw the Liberal Democrats form a government with the Conservatives after the 2010 United Kingdom general election.
In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, Scott was a keen advocate of a ""No"" vote and also called for recognition of ""the Northern Isles' right to determine their own future.""[9] At the Liberal Democrat party conference in 2013, he put forward a motion with fellow MSP Liam McArthur to recognise the islands had a  ""separate right to self-determination"".[10] Scott said that his preferred outcome was for Shetland to become a crown dependency of the United Kingdom with its own parliament[10] and was backed by the cross-party Wir Shetland movement, which campaigns for crown dependency status.[11]Scott announced in June 2019 that he would be resigning from the Scottish Parliament to take a position with the Scottish Rugby Union.[12]

He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Mid Scotland and Fife from 2003 to 2011.

Career[edit]
Brocklebank was previously a journalist and a television producer, having been Head of News and Current Affairs at Grampian Television. He stood for the Fife North East constituency in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, coming second to Liberal Democrat Iain Smith. This was repeated in the 2003 election, although the Conservatives' share of the vote increased. This time however, Brocklebank was elected through the regional list for Mid Scotland and Fife.
Brocklebank was the rural affairs spokesman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, and a member of the party's Shadow Cabinet. In February 2007 he resigned from the Shadow Cabinet after David Cameron changed the party's stance on fisheries, specifically the threat of withdrawal from the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.[1] Mr Brocklebank did not seek re-election at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.

As Sturgeon said ""...anybody who chooses to live in Scotland [...] this is their home"", White interrupted and shouted across the chamber, ""unless you're English"".[6] She later apologised and withdrew her remark in the parliamentary chamber.[7]On 12 January 2022, White called for Boris Johnson to resign as Conservative party leader and Prime Minister over the Westminster lockdown parties controversy along with a majority of Scottish Conservative MSPs.[8]

Sheridan was active as a Militant entryist in the Labour Party until 1989 when Labour expelled him,[6] and became a member of Scottish Militant Labour (SML), which eventually became the core of the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP). He was a prominent campaigner against the Poll tax (officially known as the Community Charge) in Scotland, and was jailed for six months for attending a warrant sale in 1991 after Glasgow Sheriff Court had served a court order on him banning his presence.[7] He was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as a Glasgow representative and re-elected in 2003 despite, in 2000 and 2002, being jailed over the non-payment of fines levied in connection with breach of the peace convictions resulting from his actions at demonstrations against the presence of the nuclear fleet at the Faslane Naval Base.[8]In 2006, in the case of Sheridan v News International, he won an action for defamation against the News of the World and was awarded £200,000 damages. The following year, he was charged with perjury for having told lies to the court in his defamation case.[9] In the following weeks, six of his relations and colleagues were also charged. In October 2010, he appeared together with his wife Gail at a trial for perjury. On 23 December 2010, Sheridan was convicted of perjury, and on 26 January he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.[10] The charges against his wife were withdrawn. In the light of the News of the World phone hacking affair, the Crown Office was ordered to reassess the case in 2011.[11] Sheridan left prison in January 2012 under automatic early release rules.[12]
Early life[edit]
Sheridan's mother was Alice Sheridan, a political activist who stood as a candidate for political groups involving her son.
Sheridan, raised in Roman Catholic faith, attended St Monica's Primary (Pollok) and Lourdes Secondary before studying at the University of Stirling, where he received a degree in economics. He obtained a MSc in Social Research at the University of Strathclyde in 2008.[13] He studied law at Strathclyde Law School, on the two-year fast track degree, graduating in 2015.[14][15] He also played football at Junior level with Larkhall Thistle, Benburb, East Kilbride Thistle, Baillieston Juniors and St Anthony's.[16][17][18]
Political career, 1983–2009[edit]
Early activism[edit]
Sheridan became a member of the Militant group while a student at Stirling University in around 1983 after being active in a broad-based anti-Trotskyist group including Liberals and Communists as well as Labour Party members.[6] After graduation, he went to Cardonald College as a typing student as part of an (unsuccessful) effort on the part of Militant to recruit Scottish Labour Students in further education colleges. The Labour Party, led by Neil Kinnock at the time, found that Militant contravened the Labour Party constitution, and Sheridan himself was expelled from the Labour Party in 1989 for ""bringing the party into disrepute"".[6]From within Militant, he was the public face of a mass non-payment campaign against the Community Charge in Scotland (where it was introduced a year earlier than other parts of the UK ""as an experiment""). The campaign involving the refusal to pay the tax, together with resistance to warrant sales which local councils held to try to recoup the money, was ultimately successful and Sheridan became a popular political figure. Sheridan denounced those who fought the police in the large-scale riot against the poll tax in London – which took place on 31 March 1990, the day before the tax was introduced in England and Wales – and publicly threatened to ""name names"". The police widely advertised for people to tell them the names of alleged rioters, and partly as a result of police acting on such information, over 100 individuals were jailed. With Joan McAlpine, he published A Time to Rage which chronicled the anti-poll tax movement of the late-1980s and early-1990s. McAlpine has since written about the Sheridan she became close to, with reference in particular to the defamation case.
As the highest profile Militant member in Scotland, Sheridan was a leading figure in the group's split in the early-1990s. Emboldened by the success of the campaign against the poll tax, many Militant members – particularly in Scotland – argued for the abandonment of entryism and for the creation of Scottish Militant Labour and Militant Labour in England and Wales as separate political parties.
The argument was resolved when Sheridan and his supporters won a vote at a special conference held in Bridlington in October 1991, defeating the faction around Militant founder Ted Grant who argued against abandoning the Labour Party. The result was a split in the Militant in what has become known as the 'Scottish Turn'; Scottish Militant Labour had gained six councillors in Glasgow by 1993, including Sheridan.[6] With a strong Scottish National Party (SNP), Scottish Militant Labour argued in favour of founding a new, left-wing political party. Discussions were held with other left-wing and Scottish republican groups and a new group was formed in 1996 known initially as the Scottish Socialist Alliance. In 1998, the new Scottish Socialist Party was formed from the SSA. Differences over political strategy and priorities within the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI) soon surfaced, especially on the issue of Scottish independence, leading to a split within the CWI and Sheridan along with the majority of Scottish supporters left the organisation.[citation needed]Sheridan fought two elections while in prison, coming second in the Pollok constituency at the 1992 general election, gaining nearly 20%, a result ahead of three candidates, but behind the elected Labour Party MP. A few weeks later he won the Pollok ward on Glasgow District Council. He contested the European Parliament election in 1994 as the SML candidate in Glasgow, and came third with 8% of votes cast.

Election to the Scottish Parliament[edit]
Sheridan was a leading figure in negotiations to establish the Scottish Socialist Alliance in 1996, which evolved into the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in 1998. He became the convenor of the party and was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 as a Glasgow representative and re-elected in 2003. Together with Alan McCombes he published Imagine, an outline of the principles of socialism for a modern era.
Sheridan was active in implementing long-needed changes in Scottish law, including the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 and the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001, which he introduced as bills in Holyrood on 6 December 2001.[citation needed]On 11 November 2004, Sheridan stepped down as convenor of the SSP, citing his wife Gail's pregnancy as a prime reason.[19] The resignation was steeped in controversy. It later emerged that the party's executive committee voted unanimously to force Sheridan to resign after a 9 November meeting in which he confirmed stories printed about a then-unnamed MSP were about him,[20] and indicated he would take legal action against the paper.[21]Following Sheridan's resignation, the News of the World named him as the MSP they said had had an extramarital affair and visited a swingers' club in Manchester.[22] The party declined to support him in legal action against the paper. He later branded those who refused to support him as ""scabs"".[23][24]The minutes of the meeting which detailed the deliberations leading to Sheridan's resignation were kept confidential until subpoenaed by News International. After he refused to release the minutes to the Court of Session, Alan McCombes was jailed for twelve days by Judge Lady Smith.[25] At an emergency meeting of the party's National Council, it was agreed the minutes should be handed over[26] — with only 60 delegates opposed — in order to secure McCombes' release the following day.[27]The minutes included a discussion by the party's executive committee about a recent article that alleged a married MSP had visited a swingers' club in Manchester. According to the minute, Sheridan admitted that he had in fact visited the club on two occasions, in 1996 and 2002, with close friends. Some of those present at the meeting gave evidence that they had heard Sheridan acknowledge he had been ""reckless"" in his behaviour which had, with hindsight, been ""a mistake"" and that ""his strategy was to deny the allegations"". Sheridan claimed this minute was not accurate.[28][29]Eleven members, including four of the party's MSPs, stated they heard Sheridan admit to visiting the swingers' club at that meeting. Rosemary Byrne MSP and two other members of the executive committee, Graham McIver and Pat Smith, gave evidence that Sheridan made no such statement.[30] The minutes record that Sheridan left the meeting early, but before leaving, ""he repeated that he did not believe there was any evidence which would prove him to be lying. He did not accept that he should admit the visits to the club and felt that no-one should comment on private lives"".
At the annual conference of the SSP in early 2005, Sheridan was elected to the SSP executive and at the March 2006 conference, he was elected as party co-chair. However Sheridan left the SSP in August 2006, accusing the SSP of being part of ""the mother of all stitch-ups"" involving not only their leadership, but also MI5 and News International.[31] He launched a new political party called Solidarity.[32]Sheridan was originally set to re-contest the post Scottish Socialist Party convenor at the October 2006 conference,[33] and Colin Fox claimed he had only established the new party because he did not stand a chance of winning back that role as SSP convenor.[32]
Activism and arrests at Faslane[edit]
Sheridan was first arrested at the Faslane nuclear base, the location of Britain's Trident submarine fleet, for a breach of the peace offence committed during a demonstration in February 2000.[34] He was convicted on this count, and for resisting arrest, when the case came to trial in November, and was fined £250. Believing nuclear weapons to be illegal under international law,[35] Sheridan made it clear at the time that he had no intention of paying the fine.[36] He served five days of a 14-day jail sentence the next month for this reason, and was released on 22 December.[37]Sheridan was arrested again at Faslane on 22 October 2001 shortly after the protest began at 7 am.[38][39] He was cleared when the case came to court in June 2002, the Justice of the Peace said there was insufficient evidence.[40][41] Another acquittal in October 2001, this time regarding a February 2001 protest,[42] led to an appeal by the Crown Office, but this was rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh in October 2002.[43]Sheridan was one of the first to be arrested for a breach of the peace at a demonstration at Faslane on 11 February 2002.[44][45] He was found guilty in February 2003 and fined £200,[46] but he refused to pay and was sent to prison for non-payment on 25 August 2003.[8] This time, he was sentenced to seven days in jail, serving 3 days,[47] plus the night in custody after his arrest.[48] Before presenting himself for arrest at Glasgow police station on 24 August 2003, Sheridan had told reporters: ""Nuclear weapons are a crime against humanity and should be removed from the Clyde and from Britain.""[8]
Split from the Scottish Socialist Party[edit]
In September 2006, Tommy Sheridan formed a new political party in Scotland named Solidarity, with himself and fellow MSP Rosemary Byrne as joint convenors.[49] Sheridan narrowly failed to be re-elected in the 2007 Holyrood election as top of his party's list nominees for Glasgow. The party also stood a candidate in by-elections in 2008 in Glasgow East and the Glenrothes, and Sheridan himself stood in the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election.
Sheridan stood as a candidate in the 2009 European Parliament elections for No to EU – Yes to Democracy, a left-wing alter-globalisation coalition led by RMT union leader Bob Crow.[50][51]Sheridan resigned as the co-convenor of Solidarity in June 2016, but returned as convener in 2019.[4][5] In 2020, Solidarity signed up for Action for Independence, a new pro-independence alliance.[52]In March 2021 he and his wife Gail joined the Alba Party.[53][54]
Defamation action[edit]
Main article: Sheridan v News Group Newspapers Ltd
Hearings in Sheridan's defamation case against the publishers of the News of the World began in the Court of Session in Edinburgh on 4 July 2006.[55] Unusually in Scottish civil proceedings, the case was heard before a jury.
The jury heard allegations that Sheridan had visited a swingers clubs in Manchester and engaged in adulterous affairs with two women.[56] Sheridan, who claims to be a teetotaller, reportedly drank champagne and consumed cocaine during an extramarital liaison.[57] Sheridan denies drinking the champagne and the claim of substance abuse. Eleven members of the SSP's executive committee testified that he admitted in an executive committee meeting to attending a swingers club with women,[58][59] but another four members of the SSP who were present at that Executive meeting backed Sheridan's claim that he made no such admission at that meeting.[60]On 14 July 2006, Sheridan sacked his legal team and began representing himself.[61] His cross-examination of witnesses was described by one left commentator as ""sickening"", singling out the cross-examination of Katrine Trolle: ""Sheridan questioned her about their sexual history, which included visits to Cupids with Sheridan and group sex encounters with him and his brother-in-law, Andrew McFarlane. When she stated that she was embarrassed about her past, but that she was telling the truth, Sheridan unflinching brandished her as a perjurer, plotter and gold-digger. [...] I still find it astonishing, and not a little dispiriting, that anyone on the left – any decent human being in fact – could justify traducing a female socialist's character in court, not once, but twice, in order to protect a leading socialist politician's false reputation.""[62]On 4 August 2006, Sheridan won his case with a majority verdict of 7–4 and the jury awarded him maximum damages of £200,000.[63] The News of the World has appealed the verdict. In the Scottish Socialist Voice of 8 August, a letter signed by a further six leading members of the SSP claimed that Sheridan had told them that he had admitted at an SSP Executive meeting to attending the Manchester swingers club.
The News of the World intended to appeal against what they described as the ""perverse"" decision in the immediate aftermath of the trial, and a provisional date for the hearing was set for December 2007, however it was postponed until the outcome of the procurator fiscal's perjury probe.[64]
Allegations of witness intimidation[edit]
On 10 October 2006, BBC News reported that Grampian Police were investigating a claim by Fiona McGuire, who had been a witness in the trial for the News of the World, that she had received a death threat through the post. In a statement to the BBC, Sheridan said: ""I utterly condemn any threats to Fiona McGuire or any other individual"".[65]On 26 August 2007, the Sunday Herald reported that John Lynn had been questioned by detectives about allegations of witness tampering. Lynn is reportedly an associate of Paul Ferris, a reformed criminal who has become friendly with Sheridan. The report said Helen Allison, who claimed in court that she saw Sheridan having sex in a Glasgow hotel, had been approached by Lynn who asked her not to give evidence. Lynn was once jailed for 17 years for shooting an Ulster barman.[66]
Hidden video[edit]
On 1 October 2006, the News of the World reignited controversy by publishing new evidence in support of its claim that Sheridan lied to the Court of Session. It was a video recording of Sheridan admitting he had visited a swingers club in Manchester on two occasions and further, that he had, as other senior SSP members claimed in court, admitted this at an Executive meeting of the SSP. The tape had been made without Sheridan's knowledge using a hidden camera by SSP member George McNeilage in McNeilage's house after he invited Sheridan there. McNeilage had been one of three best men at Sheridan's wedding.
Sheridan does not appear clearly on the video at any time. The newspaper has not been able to produce any images from the video showing Sheridan's face and Sheridan says the video is a fake. He conceded his voice was on the tape but suggested it was spliced with clips of the voice of someone else.[67] The News of the World claimed four independent voice analysts had confirmed that the voice on the tape is that of Tommy Sheridan.[68] However, in an interview with the BBC a forensic speech scientist, Peter French, said: ""Experts should never say conclusively they have identified a person and this kind of evidence should never solely be used to bring a criminal trial"".[69]Sheridan then suggested that MI5, someone within the SSP, Rupert Murdoch and Bill Gates had conspired to concoct the videotape to undermine his campaign for an independent socialist Scotland.[70]
Perjury conviction[edit]
Main article: HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan
HM Prison BarlinnieThe conflicting evidence given during the trial resulted in the judge warning several witnesses about the implications of perjuring themselves. On Monday 7 August 2006, Lothian and Borders Police said they had received two complaints of perjury, one from the former Conservative MSP Brian Monteith,[71] the other alleged to be from the SSP's minutes secretary.[72]On 22 August 2006, the Crown Office instructed the Edinburgh Procurators Fiscal office to ascertain if there were grounds for a criminal investigation. On 2 October 2006, it was concluded that there were and Lothian and Borders Police were instructed to start a criminal investigation.[73] On 21 February 2007, The Herald reported that the Crown Office had asked Lothian and Borders Police to undertake a full inquiry after receiving a preliminary report.[74]In May 2007, it was reported that staff at Cupid's Swingers Club in Manchester had told police they had been offered bribes not to co-operate with the inquiry.[75]On 16 December 2007, Sheridan was charged with perjury in relation to the News of the World case.[76] In a public statement outside the police station he attributed his arrest to the ""powerful reach"" of the Murdoch press. During February 2008, his wife Gail, former SSP MSP Rosemary Byrne, former members of the SSP Executive Committee, Patricia Smith, Graeme McIver, Jock Penman, and Sheridan's father-in-law, Angus Healey, were also charged with perjury.
On 27 January 2009, Sheridan and his wife were indicted for perjury, and were summoned to attend a pre-trial hearing at Edinburgh High Court on 26 February.[77] however this was postponed until 11 May.[78]The trial started at Glasgow High Court on 4 October 2010. Sheridan's initial defence team included Donald Findlay, who was replaced by Maggie Scott.[79][80] However, a few weeks into the case, Sheridan instructed his Solicitor Aamer Anwar, who had defended him since 2007, to withdraw Scott's instructions. He then conducted his own defence, with Anwar assisting him as amicus curiae.
On 23 December 2010 a jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury and on 26 January 2011 he was sentenced to 3 years in prison.[81]
Initially he was held in Barlinnie prison in Glasgow, but after several weeks he was moved to a semi-open wing in Barlinnie, and on 21 June he was moved to Castle Huntly open prison.[82][83] Sheridan was released to a Home Detention Curfew on 30 January 2012, having served just over one year of his sentence.[84]Sheridan and Aamer Anwar subsequently parted company, with Gordon Dangerfield acting as his lawyer.[85]In 2015 the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission declined to refer the case to the High Court.[86]
Support for Sheridan[edit]
A ""Defend Tommy Sheridan"" campaign was launched by sympathetic trade unionists and politicians to demand why Sheridan was being investigated. In December 2007, Sunday Herald columnist Iain MacWhirter said it was ""hard not to conclude that the police's diligence has been inspired by Rupert Murdoch's News International.""[87] The campaign drew support from the politician George Galloway and leading trade unionist Bob Crow (RMT). At a June 2008 rally organised by the campaign, speakers including FBU secretary Kenny Ross, Paddy Hill, and Gerry Conlon queried the motives for the investigation, questioned the role of the police and Crown Office and verbally attacked the witnesses who had given evidence unhelpful to Sheridan in the original hearing.

Claims of illegal surveillance[edit]
In March 2007, Lothian and Borders Police investigated claims that Tommy Sheridan had been bugged after a suspicious device was found in his car. The device was described as ""not of the kind used by British security services"".[88]A complaint submitted to Strathclyde Police in July 2011 lead to Operation Rubicon, a major investigation involving 50 officers investigating allegations of phone hacking, breach of data protection and perjury by News of the World. In May 2012, Andy Coulson, editor of the News of the World from 2003 – 2007 and who gave evidence at Sheridan's trial,[89] was detained ""on suspicion of committing perjury before the High Court in Glasgow"".[90] On 7 July 2014, following Coulson's conviction on phone hacking charges, Coulson himself faced perjury charges over Sheridan's trial,[91] and on 23 February 2015, a pre-evidential hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh set a trial date of 21 April.[92] On 3 June 2015, Coulson was formally acquitted after the case against him was dismissed by a judge.[93]
News Group appeal against defamation award (2016)[edit]
An appeal hearing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh against the 2006 defamation award in light of Sheridan's later perjury conviction began on 10 May 2016.[94] New Group Newspapers (now part of News UK) lost their appeal against the award of £200,000 damages to Sheridan on 19 August 2016.[95]
Publications[edit]
Sheridan's rise and extinction are dealt with in two works of political analysis: Downfall by his erstwhile colleague Alan McCombes (2011), and Tommy Sheridan: From Hero to Zero? by Gregor Gall (2012).

Later career and other activities[edit]
Scottish independence referendum[edit]
In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Sheridan embarked on a pro-independence speaking tour under the banner ""Hope Over Fear"".[96] By June 2014, four pro-independence groups — Women for Independence, Labour for Independence, Generation Yes, and the Radical Independence Campaign — had adopted a policy of refusing Sheridan a platform during the campaign. According to a report in the Sunday Herald, pro-independence figures ""believe Sheridan is piggy-backing on the independence campaign to gain publicity for an appeal against his conviction"".[97]Following the defeat of the Yes campaign, Sheridan called for a Scottish National Party (SNP) vote at the 2015 general election for the Westminster parliament, which he said would force a second independence referendum by 2020.[98] He was later a headline speaker at a Hope Over Fear rally in George Square on Sunday 12 October, where he sparked controversy by asking for donations to be sent to his home address.[99] He asked for cheques to be made out to a community group run by a former Solidarity candidate.[100] Ahead of the rally, former MSP Rosie Kane said: ""Try to understand that Tommy is a divisive and manipulative character. By all means go along, but don't for a minute imagine that this is an open, inclusive and friendly event. This is ego at its most manipulative.""[101]
Broadcasting[edit]
Tommy Sheridan had a weekly Sunday morning show on Talk 107 for 18 months, but the station did not renew his contract due to cutbacks and changes to programming that saw Mike Graham and others leave Talk107.[102] He hosted a chat show during the Edinburgh fringe in 2007, which received muted reviews.[citation needed] He appeared in the Celebrity version of Big Brother UK. He was the fifth to be evicted (during the double eviction on 21 January 2009). He received mixed reactions from the crowd upon both entry and exit, and admitted during the post-eviction interview that his primary motivation for taking part was that he ""needed the money"".[103]
Celebrant[edit]
By 30 June 2018, Sheridan trained to become a humanist celebrant.[104] Sheridan cited the reason as his occasional role presiding over funerals.[105]

She was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2016. Elected as a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), she suspended her membership in 2011 upon her election as presiding officer, following the tradition of the presiding officer being nonpartisan.[2]Born in Cowdenbeath and raised in Fife, she worked for Shelter Scotland before becoming a politician. In the first ever Scottish Parliament election, Marwick ran as an SNP candidate for the Central Fife constituency, but came second to Henry McLeish. Although she failed to win the seat in two elections, she was elected as an additional member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region. In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, she defeated Scottish Labour's Christine May, and was elected to serve as the MSP for Central Fife.
Following the 2011 election to the 4th Scottish Parliament, Marwick was elected to the newly drawn Mid Fife and Glenrothes constituency. With the SNP's outright majority, she was elected as the fourth Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. Marwick is the first woman to hold the position of office. As the Presiding Officer is a non-partisan role, she was forced to relinquish her party affiliation. She stood down from the Scottish Parliament in the 2016 election and the from 2016 to 2020, she served as chair of the NHS Fife board.

Early life and career[edit]
Patricia Lee was born on 5 November 1953 in Cowdenbeath and was brought up in Fife, one of seven siblings.[3][4] She worked as Public Affairs Officer for Shelter Scotland, a charity for homeless people, from 1992 to 1999.[5][6]

She served on the SNP opposition frontbench team as Deputy Business Manager (1999–2000), Shadow Minister for Local Government (2004), Business Manager and Chief Whip (2004–2005) and Shadow Minister for Housing (2005–2007). Marwick served as a member of the Scottish Parliament's Standards, Justice and Home Affairs, Equal Opportunities, Local Government and Communities committees and as convenor of the Waverly Railway (Scotland) Bill committee (2004–06).
At the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary election she contested the Central Fife seat and, although she narrowly failed to win the seat, she was re-elected to serve as a member for Mid Scotland and Fife. Marwick contested Central Fife again in 2007 and was elected as the constituencies MSP after defeating the Labour incumbent, Christine May, with a majority of 1,166 votes.
Following the 2007 election Marwick was appointed as the SNP's representative on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, and oversaw parliamentary access and information issues.

Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament[edit]
In the 2011 election, Marwick was elected for the Mid Fife and Glenrothes constituency, essentially a redrawing of her old Central Fife seat.  On 11 May 2011, when Parliament reconvened, Marwick was elected to serve as the 4th Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, having won support from the majority of members in the second round of voting.[7] She became the first woman and second SNP member to serve in the position. In October 2012, Marwick accepted a nomination to join the Privy Council, meaning that she is styled the Rt Hon. Tricia Marwick MSP.[8]On 29 May 2015, it was announced that Marwick would stand down as Presiding Officer at the 2016 election.[9] She also left elected politics as a whole.[10] Upon standing down, she was made an offer to have her name put forward for an honour from the Queen but turned the offer down.[11]
After Parliament[edit]
Marwick was announced as the new chair for the NHS Fife board in November 2016, replacing Allan Burns who resigned from the post in August 2016.[12] Her appointment as chair ran from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2020.[13]In 2021 Marwick tweeted journalist Fraser Nelson, who had published articles critical of the Scottish Government, that, ""We see you Fraser. We see what you are trying to do. Have never seen you challenge Westminster Governments. Scottish birth not alone does a Scotsman make, sometimes it signifies a Scotsman on the make."" Nelson replied, “While raised in the Highlands I guess I was never quite properly Scottish. How could you tell?”[14] The Scottish Conservatives said Marwick ""should clearly have known better than to pander to the most extreme wing of her party"" and she deleted the tweet.[14]In 2022 a student newspaper at St Andrew's University ran a satirical article in which it criticised Nicola Sturgeon as ""too scary"" for Hell and suggested that England “boot Scotland out of the union”. Marwick denounced St Andrew's as “not a Fife university” and described students as “pathetic wee trolls”. “I regret the Saint run by the University of St Andrews students just buys into every stereotype we Fifers have of them,"" she tweeted. “Poor souls who failed to get into Oxbridge display every prejudice; anti Scottish and anti women.” Local MSP Willie Rennie and MP Wendy Chamberlain said: “It was one article, published by one student out of several thousand students and staff at St Andrews. It does not represent the views of staff and students. It was therefore wholly unacceptable for the chair of NHS Fife to trash the whole university with offensive remarks too.” Marwick later deleted the tweet.[15]

Personal detailsBornPatricia Leonard(1939-10-31)31 October 1939Glasgow, ScotlandDied21 July 2019(2019-07-21) (aged 79)Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish LabourSpouseNorman GodmanChildren3Patricia Godman (née Leonard; 31 October 1939 – 21 July 2019) was a Scottish Labour politician who served as Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2003 to 2011. She was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West Renfrewshire constituency from 1999 to 2011.

Background[edit]
The daughter of Martin Leonard and Cathie Craig, Godman was a Glasgow City councillor before entering the Scottish Parliament.
After leaving St Gerard's Senior Secondary School, Glasgow aged 15, Godman worked with a charity for some time, as a waitress, in a bar, insurance collector and a house mother in a list 'D' school. She later attended Jordanhill College where she trained as a social worker.[1] She worked as a social worker working in the East End of Glasgow from 1979 to 1989.[2]From 2003 until 2011, Godman was a Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament.[3] In 2008, it was revealed she charged the taxpayer around £30,000 for hotel bills although she was renting a flat from her son Gary Mulgrew.[4] She did not qualify for the rental expenses allowance as her main residence in Glasgow was too close to Holyrood to qualify, but claimed rent rather than hotel expenses. She was entitled to an overnight expenses allowance that permitted MSPs to recoup expenses for each night, which she had paid for the rent of the apartment. It was confirmed that she had neither broken the Parliamentary rules, nor benefited in any way.[5]On her final day in parliament, Godman wore a Celtic F. C. shirt in Holyrood. A few days later, a bomb addressed to her office was intercepted, with similar devices being sent to Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Paul McBride, Lennon's legal representative. It was believed that Godman was targeted for wearing the shirt.[6] Trevor Muirhead and Neil McKenzie were later convicted for sending the bombs.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Godman married her second husband Norman Godman in 1981,[2] who was a Member of Parliament for Greenock and Inverclyde and its predecessor seat from 1983 to 2001.[8] She had three sons by her first husband, from whom she separated aged 22 due to his infidelity.[2] One, Gary Mulgrew, was one of the NatWest Three.[9] Her experience with his extradition inspired her to take an active role in opposing Gary McKinnon's extradition to the United States in a similar case.[10]Godman died on 21 July 2019 in Clydebank, after fighting with a terminal illness.[3]

She held various Scottish Government cabinet posts and was the Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland from 2007 to 2008. In 2010–2011 she convened the Scotland Bill Committee on financial powers of the Scottish Parliament.
After leaving politics, she was appointed Associate Dean of Global Business and Associate Dean for Degree Programmes and Career Services at the London Business School, and in April 2015 was appointed as Vice-Principal (International) and Professor of International Education by the University of Dundee.[2][3]
In March 2016 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for her work for the university sector.[4] In 30 November 2017, she was appointed as the Scottish Government Trade and Investment Envoy for Higher Education.[5]Alexander is a member of UK Government’s DIT/DfE Education Sector Advisory Group and chairs the Global Advisory Board of the Times Higher Education Student. [6]
Early life and education[edit]
Alexander was born on 27 June 1963 in Glasgow to Dr Joyce O. Alexander and Reverend Douglas N. Alexander.[7] Alexander attended Park Mains High School in Erskine and won a scholarship to Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific in British Columbia before studying at the University of Glasgow, where she graduated with a First Class MA (Hons) in Economic and Modern History. She later gained a postgraduate MA in Industrial Relations from the University of Warwick, and an MBA from INSEAD. She was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Strathclyde in 2007.

Early career[edit]
After her MBA Alexander worked for Booz & Co., an international management consultancy, undertaking assignments in Europe, Asia, North America and Australasia.

Adviser to Donald Dewar[edit]
Following Labour's landslide victory at the 1997 general election, Alexander was appointed Special Adviser to Donald Dewar when he became Secretary of State for Scotland. She was deeply involved in the preparation of the White Paper on devolution, the Scotland Act 1998 and preparations for the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, all matters she had published on during the 1990s.

Member of Scottish Parliament[edit]
Wendy Alexander served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from its creation in 1999 until 2011.

Ministerial career[edit]
html bodyhtml@media(min-width:720px){}The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met.  (October 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)From 1999 to 2002 Wendy Alexander was a Scottish Government minister, first serving as Minister for Communities, then as Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, and subsequently as Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning.
As Communities Minister she launched the free central heating installation programme for all pensioners without a system.[8] She oversaw the creation of the first social justice report, ""A Scotland where everyone matters – our vision for Social Justice"",[9] setting ambitious new targets for delivering social justice and defeating child poverty in Scotland, and an Annual Scottish Social Justice Report to measure progress towards those targets.[10][11]She set up the Homelessness Task Force, which led to radical homelessness legislation[12][13] and she championed the community ownership of housing by tenants including the removal of £1.6bn of Glasgow debt.[14][15] The tenants subsequently voted in a referendum 2:1 in favour of transfer – the largest of its kind in the UK, involving 89,000 homes.
As Communities Minister, Alexander fought hard to bring about the repeal of Section 28 to contribute to social acceptance and greater equality for the LGBT community by removing a ban on the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities.[16] in the face of a sustained campaign by Stagecoach millionaire and later SNP donor Brian Souter to keep the legislation. In the end the repeal, contained in the  ethical Standards in Public Life (Scotland) Bill[17] was passed by 99 votes to 17.[18] During the final debate, Alexander said, ""Repeal is not, and never has been, about the promotion of homosexuality in our schools. It is not about political correctness or, even less, about marriage. It is about building a tolerant Scotland. We know that teachers are confused about the meaning of section 2A, we know that bullying exists in our schools and elsewhere, and we know that children's organisations overwhelmingly back repeal.""[19]Alexander oversaw the Scottish Executive's response to the recommendations of the McIntosh Commission into the future of local government in Scotland,[20] introducing a package of measures for local government[21][22] including giving local authorities the lead role in developing Community Planning, creating a formal Power of Community Initiative (later known as a power of well-being) and establishing the Renewing Local Democracy (Kerley) Working Party on electoral systems.[23] Building on the work of the Best Value Taskforce, she also announced plans for a statutory duty to secure Best Value in local government services.[24]She also published the first Equality Statement to Parliament, established the Executive's Equalities Unit,[25][26] announced the first Scottish-wide fund to tackle violence against women – the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund[27] – and the first national loan fund,[28] administered by a new organisation – Social Investment Scotland[29] – to invest in emerging social enterprises and ""make it easier for the voluntary sector to emerge as an effective third force, alongside the traditional public and private sectors"".[30][31]As Enterprise Minister Alexander launched Smart, Successful Scotland,[32] a widely welcomed new economic strategy for Scotland[33] supporting high-skill, high-value investment such as that by Rolls-Royce.[34] She launched Scotland's first ever Science strategy[35][36] and developed a better pipeline to get ideas out of labs and into businesses, including the Proof of Concept Fund[37] and the Scottish Co-Investment Fund[38] to stimulate private venture capital investment in emerging businesses.[39] She also championed the first broadband strategy for Scotland and took action to tackle the 'digital divide'.[40][41][42]Alexander promoted a ""learning, earning"" nation including the doubling of the number of Modern Apprenticeships,[43] jointly leading the Clyde Shipyards Taskforce[44] to help modernise shipbuilding on the Clyde through investment in skills,[45] and in the face of the global downturn in electronics hitting companies such as Motorola launched what became the PACE (Partnership for Continuing Employment[46]) initiative to help those made redundant find work quickly. 
As Minister with responsibility for skills and lifelong learning she promoted higher education enterprise links and championed research, modernising management[47] and widening access to universities by those previously excluded.[48] She also extended Educational Maintenance Allowances to support pupils from low income families to complete their schooling.[49]Alexander launched a new international economic strategy for Scotland called Global Connections[50] realigning Scotland's international economic effort with the Smart Successful Scotland strategy,[51] bringing together Scotland's previously separate inward investment and export agencies into one organisation, Scotland Development International[52][53] and created the Globalscot network[54] to develop and expand Scotland's standing in the global business community.
Alexander resigned from ministerial office on 4 May 2002. After her resignation from Jack McConnell's Cabinet she became a visiting professor at the Strathclyde Business School and became a member, and subsequently Chair of the Scottish Parliament's Finance Committee. She inspired and led the Allander Series of seminars which had the aim of encouraging fresh thinking on Scotland's economic future.[55][56] The seminars brought William Baumol, Ed Glaeser and Nobel laureates James Heckman and Paul Krugman from across the spectrum of political economy to Scotland to reflect on issues such as the returns to early intervention, supporting innovation and cities as future growth engines.[57][58]She also authored Chasing the Tartan Tiger: Lessons from a Celtic Cousin? (2003),[59] co-edited (with Diane Coyle and Brian Ashcroft) New Wealth for Old Nations: Scotland’s Economic Prospects (2005),[60][61] edited an anthology of essays on the life of the late First Minister, Donald Dewar: Scotland's first First Minister (2005)[62] and wrote a non-political column for young mums in the Daily Record.

Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland[edit]
Election[edit]
Following the Scottish Parliament elections in May 2007, Alexander became Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth. Following Jack McConnell's resignation in August 2007, she announced her candidacy for Leader of the Labour Party in Scotland. Alexander laid out her vision to ""Renew the party organisation, reform the policies, and reconnect the Labour Party in Scotland with its electorate"".[63] Other contenders ruled themselves out and she was elected unopposed by Labour MSPs on 14 September 2007.[64]As the leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, Alexander believed that ""the people of Scotland told us loud and clear they wanted change. They didn't whisper – they shouted it. So change we must!""[65] She argued that Labour must offer radical change to regain the trust of voters, a vision spelt out in Scottish Labour New Directions: Change is what we do,[66] a publication outlining her views on the future policy direction for the Labour Party in Scotland.[67] Addressing Labour's Scottish Conference as Leader she spoke of the need for Labour to be the progressive party of Scotland. Alexander argued: ""'Scotland' is not a political philosophy. 'Scotland' can just as easily be Adam Smith as it can be John Smith. The world over, politics comes down to a choice: right versus left, conservatives versus progressives, nationalists versus internationalists"".[68][69]Organisationally, she called for a new approach to candidate selection, including primary systems to give all Labour supporters a chance to be involved in choosing their local member. Policy initiatives included establishing a Literacy Commission with Rhona Brankin to investigate child literacy standards in Scottish schools[70] (subsequently embraced by all parties in the Parliament),[71] supporting investment in the early years, including nursery places for all vulnerable 2-year-olds, more one-on-one tuition in schools, personalised care plans for those with chronic conditions and legislation providing for a modern apprenticeship for every qualified school leaver who sought one.

Calman Commission[edit]
Main articles: Calman Commission and Scotland Bill (2011)
Alexander made a speech at the University of Edinburgh on St Andrew's Day 2007 in which she set out the case for a wide-ranging review of the devolution settlement, with a view to identifying possible areas for reform.[72] The speech laid out her proposals for ""a more balanced home rule package"" including greater financial accountability and new tax powers for the Scottish Parliament (a cause that she had first championed when she led the Allander Series) in order that the ""Union become a more comfortable home for all its members"".[73] She said ""Scotland wants to see a future that allows her to walk taller within the UK without walking out"" and called for a new ""expert-led and independent"" Scottish constitutional commission.
As the leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, she set this in motion by working with the Conservative and Liberal Democrat leaders to set up the Commission on Scottish Devolution (aka the Calman Commission) in a ""bold cross-party, cross-border initiative"".[74][75][76] The review was established by a vote of the Scottish Parliament.[77] The Calman Commission became a unique Scottish Parliament-UK Government joint venture which reported back to the Parliament in June 2009 proposing wide-ranging changes in the financing of the Scottish Parliament.[78][79][80] Alexander wrote then ""history teaches that constitutional reform has never been gifted to Scotland. It has to be fought and argued for... Calman will shape the next phase of Scotland's journey…[with] a range of common sense measures to improve relationships"".[81]On St. Andrew's Day 2010, three years to the day after Alexander's call for a Commission, the UK Government introduced a new Scotland Bill. The proposals in the bill closely followed the commission's recommendations and proposed major new financial powers worth £12 billion, giving Holyrood control of a third of its budget. Under the legislation, Holyrood will set a Scottish income tax rate each year from 2015, applying equally to the basic, high and additional rates. The UK Government called it the ""biggest transfer of fiscal powers to Scotland since the creation of the Union.""[82] In December 2010 Alexander was appointed convener of the Scottish Parliament's Committee to report on the bill.

Scottish independence referendum[edit]
Main article: Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010
During a TV interview on 4 May 2008, Wendy Alexander suggested that she would be willing to support a referendum on Scottish Independence saying ""Bring it on!"" It was a bold move, but led to suggestions of a rift between her and the Prime Minister, who did not overtly back her.[83] On 7 May, at Prime Minister's Questions, Prime Minister, Gordon Brown stated that she was not, in fact, offering Labour's support for an immediate referendum.[84]During First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament, on 8 May, Alexander asked Alex Salmond to bring forward a referendum bill at the first opportunity. Alex Salmond declined the offer of Labour support for a referendum, preferring to delay by at least a further year, saying ""We will stick to what was laid out in pages 8 and 15 of the SNP manifesto"".[85]
Resignation over foreign donation[edit]
Main article: Labour party proxy and undeclared donations (2007)
In 2007, a controversy developed after it emerged that Alexander's campaign team had accepted a £950 impermissible donation from Paul Green, a property magnate,[86] a matter that was investigated by the Electoral Commission and Strathclyde Police.[87] When it emerged that the donation of £950 had come from a personal account, and not a business account, the money was immediately forfeited. Further newspaper reports on 30 November indicated Alexander was aware of the identity of the donor, after having sent a personal letter of gratitude to Mr Green (at his home in Jersey) concerning the donation.[88] As Mr Green was not registered as an elector in the United Kingdom this barred him from donating to a UK-based party. However, the Electoral Commission concluded in February 2008 that Alexander had taken 'significant steps' to comply with funding regulations and decided there was no basis for further action.[89] As part of the Electoral Commission ruling, they also stated that Alexander ""did not take all reasonable steps"" and that ""there is not sufficient evidence to establish that an offence has been committed"".[90]
These mixed messages have resulted in a number of people questioning the decision, including Alex Salmond the head of the Scottish Government who likened the result to a not proven verdict.[91]In a separate development, a few days earlier in February 2008, the Scottish Parliament standards watchdog reported Alexander to the procurator fiscal for failing to declare as gifts the donations that were made to the fund for her campaign for the leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland.[92] Alexander had been told by the parliamentary authorities that there was no need to declare these donations as gifts.[93] In previous leadership campaigns, campaign donations were not treated as gifts. Again the subsequent investigation led to a decision by the Crown Office to take no further action.[94]Despite this ruling, on 26 June 2008, on the eve of the Parliamentary summer recess, the SNP-led Standards Committee of the Parliament voted 4 to 3 to propose a one-day ban from the Scottish Parliament[93] as a sanction for not declaring leadership campaign donations as gifts on the Parliament's register of interests. The proposed ban was overwhelmingly rejected by the Parliament in a subsequent vote in September 2008.[95][96] However, with Holyrood going into summer recess at the time, Alexander would have had to wait until September for all MSPs to vote on the recommendation. So, rather than having the issue hanging over her – and her party – Alexander announced her resignation as leader on 28 June 2008.[97] She subsequently stated it had been a mistake for her to take on the leadership of the Labour Party in Scotland while her children were so young.[98]
Parliamentary career[edit]
From 2008 to 2011 Alexander served as a member of the Scottish Parliament's Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee. She was also convenor of the Scotland Bill Committee, which produced the report for the Scottish Parliament and UK Government in March 2011 proposing new powers for the Scottish Parliament.[99] Many of these proposals recommend greater fiscal autonomy for Scotland,[100] including improved borrowing powers, the ability to issue bonds and further tax devolution.[101] Despite the Scottish Government's initial opposition to the bill they supported the Scotland Bill Committee's recommendations, with parliament voting 121:3 in favour. In her valedictory speech on the Scotland Bill, Alexander said: ""This initiative has from beginning to end been cross-party, consensual and co-operative among the participating parties. [...] The bill will deliver the most far-reaching transfer of financial powers from London since the creation of the union. [...] In the future, all Scottish political parties will have to make decisions about raising money as well as about spending it.

Personal detailsBorn (1958-05-24) 24 May 1958 (age 65)Ayrshire, ScotlandPolitical partyScottish National PartyWilliam Lynch Coffey (born 24 May 1958) is a Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He has been a  Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley since 2011, and previously Kilmarnock and Loudoun from 2007 to 2011, before boundary changes.
Coffey studied at the University of Strathclyde where he obtained a degree in Computer Science. He subsequently worked as Software Development Manager and latterly as a Quality and Risk Manager with Learning and Teaching Scotland before his election to the Scottish Parliament. He has been a councillor on East Ayrshire Council.[1]
Politics[edit]
He was first elected to Kilmarnock and Loudoun District Council in 1992 and subsequently to East Ayrshire Council (covering the Onthank ward in northern Kilmarnock) in 1999, 2003 and 2007 before retiring from local government at the 2012 Local Elections.
He is the brother of former Provost and Cllr. Danny Coffey who came within 1,210 votes of winning the Kilmarnock and Loudoun Holyrood constituency in 2003 and died on 26 February 2006. Their sister Helen held Danny's Altonhill, Hillhead & Longpark council ward in a by-election with an increased majority and a 5.6% swing from Labour, before both she and Willie were elected to the new multi-member Kilmarnock North ward in 2007.

Scottish Parliament[edit]
Coffey won the Kilmarnock and Loudoun seat for the SNP in May 2007 with a vote of 14,297 and a majority of 1,342.[2] He serves on the Scottish Parliament's Audit Committee and has campaigned on numerous occasions to protect the Scotch whisky industry, particularly in his own area.[3][4]In 2017 Coffey was reported to Holyrood authorities for ""inappropriate language"" and ""unsolicited attention"" by a female civil servant. Coffey denied the allegation and stated that he did not recognise the claims about his behaviour.[5]In April 2022, Coffey was an object of ridicule after he was asked to open a debate which he expected to close, and failed to amend his speech accordingly: as a result, he stated that he would be ""reflecting on the contributions to this debate"", when in fact no one had spoken. He was told to sit down by the Presiding Officer.[6][7]
Committees[edit]
During his tenure as an MSP, Coffey has been a member of the following committees:[8]
Public Audit and Postlegislative Scrutiny Committee (30 March 2017 – 3 December 2020)
Economy Energy and Fair Work Committee (3 September 2019 – 10 September 2019)

Rennie speaking in 2013Rennie returned to front-line politics as an MSP when he won a regional list seat for the Liberal Democrats in the Scottish Parliament's Mid Scotland and Fife region at the Holyrood elections on 5 May 2011. He was the only new Liberal Democrat MSP to win a seat in this election.
After the resignation of leader Tavish Scott, Rennie stood in the resulting leadership election. He was the only candidate to be nominated, and was declared elected when the nominations closed on 17 May. He vowed to stand up to the ""SNP bulldozer"" majority, and refused to distance his party from the UK Liberal Democrats.[8]During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Rennie campaigned alongside Better Together to remain in the United Kingdom.[9] He opposes a second independence referendum, favouring a more federal UK.[10][11]In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the Liberal Democrats again elected five MSPs, while gaining two constituency seats and holding their existing two with increased majorities. Rennie was elected in North East Fife, gaining it from the SNP with a 9.5% swing.
Rennie was re-elected in North East Fife for the 2021 Scottish Parliament election,[12] with doubled majority.[13] On 12 July 2021, Rennie announced his resignation as leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, effective from September.[14] He was replaced by Alex Cole-Hamilton, the MSP for Edinburgh Western.[15]
Home Rule commission plan[edit]
Further information: Full fiscal autonomy for Scotland
In September 2011, Rennie announced plans for a commission building on the work of the Lord Steel Commission to develop a blueprint for Home Rule and full fiscal federalism that would map out further devolution of powers after the Scotland Bill 2011 was passed into statute.[16][17]
Armed Forces Legal Action[edit]
Willie Rennie was appointed as an honorary patron of Armed Forces Legal Action (AFLA) in April 2014. AFLA is a network of British law firms offering discounted legal services to members of the British military community, founded by Scottish solicitor and former Scottish Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate Allan Steele, WS.[18]

   ​ ​(m. 1956; died 2003)​Children3, including Fergus and AnnabelleAlma materUniversity of GlasgowProfessionSolicitorWinifred Margaret Ewing FRSA (née Woodburn; 10 July 1929 – 21 June 2023) was a Scottish politician, lawyer and figure within the independence movement who served as President of the Scottish National Party from 1987 to 2005. Ewing was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Highlands and Islands from 1999 to 2003 and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the equivalent seat from 1979 to 1999. She was also a member of the British House of Commons for Hamilton from a 1967 by-election until 1970, and for Moray and Nairn from 1974 to 1979.
Born and raised in Glasgow, Ewing studied law at the University of Glasgow, where she joined the university's Scottish Nationalist Association. After graduating, she worked as a lawyer, serving as Secretary of the Glasgow Bar Association from 1962 to 1967. Ewing was elected to the House of Commons in the 1967 Hamilton by-election and her presence at Westminster led to a rise in membership for the SNP, from her quote; ""stop the world, Scotland wants to get on"". Although she lost her seat in the 1970 UK election, she was re-elected in February 1974, this time for the Moray and Nairn constituency. Ewing lost her seat in the 1979 election and, after making numerous attempts to seek re-election, she failed to do so.[1]Ewing was elected to the European Parliament in the 1979 elections, representing the Highlands and Islands. In the parliament, she acquired the nickname Madame Écosse (French for 'Mrs Scotland') because of her advocacy of Scottish interests at Brussels. In 1987, she became the President of the Scottish National Party, succeeding Ian Hudghton. She served as Vice President of the European Radical Alliance and by 1995 had become Britain's longest serving MEP. In the first elections to the Scottish Parliament, she was elected to serve as an MSP for Highlands and Islands. As the oldest qualified member, it was her duty to preside over the opening of the Scottish Parliament.

Early life[edit]
Ewing was born Winifred Margaret Woodburn on 10 July 1929 in Glasgow, to Christina Bell Anderson and George Woodburn, a small business owner.[2][3][4] She was educated at Battlefield School and Queen's Park Secondary School. In 1946 she matriculated at the University of Glasgow where she graduated with an MA and LLB.[2] Although relatively inactive in politics at that time, she joined the Student Nationalists.[5] Following her graduation, she qualified and practised as a solicitor and notary public. She was Secretary of the Glasgow Bar Association from 1962 to 1967.[6]
Political career[edit]
Ewing became active in campaigning for Scottish independence through her membership of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association, and won the 1967 Hamilton by-election as the Scottish National Party (SNP) candidate.[7][8] She was elected with the help of a team including her election agent, John McAteer. On 16 November, she made her first appearance at Westminster, with her husband and children accompanying her on the journey.[9] She arrived at the parliament in a Scottish-built Hillman Imp and was greeted by a crowd and a pipe band.[10]Ewing said at the time ""stop the world, Scotland wants to get on"", and her presence at Westminster led to a rise in membership for the SNP.[5] It was speculated that Ewing's electoral gain led to the establishment of the Kilbrandon Commission by the Labour government of Harold Wilson to look into the viability of a devolved Scottish Assembly. In hindsight it could be said to mark the start of modern politics in Scotland, according to Professor Richard Finlay of Strathclyde University, bringing young people and women from non-political backgrounds into politics for the first time, whilst Labour and Tory party organisation and branch numbers were declining.[11]Despite her high profile, Ewing was unsuccessful in retaining the Hamilton seat at the 1970 general election.[12] At the following February 1974 election she stood for Moray and Nairn and was returned to Westminster, although another election followed in October of the same year when her already marginal majority declined. Following the October election she was announced as the SNP's spokesperson on external affairs and the EEC.[13] She first became an MEP in 1975, at a time when the European Parliament was still composed of representative delegations from national parliaments.[11] She lost her Westminster seat at the May 1979 election, but within weeks had gained a seat in the European Parliament at the first direct elections to the Parliament. Ewing was unsuccessful at seeking to return to Westminster as the SNP candidate for Orkney and Shetland in 1983, coming third.[14]Ewing was elected the SNP Party President in 1987.[6] It was during her time as an MEP that she acquired the nickname Madame Écosse (French for 'Mrs Scotland') because of her advocacy of Scottish interests in Strasbourg and Brussels.[15][16] That sobriquet was first used by Le Monde and with Ewing using the term as a badge of pride, it stuck.[17] By 1995 she had become Britain's longest serving MEP.[17] She served as Vice President of the European Radical Alliance,[18] which in addition to the SNP also included French, Belgian, Italian and Spanish MEPs.
In 1999, she did not stand for the European Parliament, instead becoming a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) in the first session of the Scottish Parliament, representing the Highlands and Islands. As the oldest qualified member,[19][20] it was her duty to preside over the opening of the Scottish Parliament,[21] a session she opened with the statement: ""The Scottish Parliament, adjourned on the 25th day of March in the year 1707, is hereby reconvened"".[22] She sat as a member on the European Committee and the Public Petitions Committee.[23]During the controversy that arose in the early years of the Scottish Parliament surrounding proposals to repeal Clause 28 (a law banning the active promotion of homosexuality in schools), she joined her son Fergus Ewing in abstaining, although her daughter in law Margaret Ewing supported repeal as did the majority of her party's MSPs. In June 2001, having turned 72 years old, she announced that she would retire from Parliament at the end of the session.[24] In January 2003, her husband, Stewart Ewing, died from a heart attack after a fire at their home.[25] He had been active with her in politics for many years, and had himself served as an SNP councillor for the Summerston area in Glasgow, gaining the seat of Dick Dynes, the leader of the Labour Group on Glasgow District Council in 1977, a result described by The Glasgow Herald as ""an absolute sensation"".[26] Later in 2003 she stood down from being an MSP,[27] although she continued to serve as the SNP's President. On 15 July 2005, she announced she would be stepping down as President of the Scottish National Party at its September Conference, bringing to an end her 38-year career in representative politics.[28]Nicola Sturgeon said that Ewing had given her ""hugely valuable advice"" on public speaking, and that Ewing had given her some important advice as a young woman in politics, namely ""Stand your ground and believe in yourself"" and ""a more vibrant, colourful, dynamic, passionate, committed person, you would struggle to meet.""[3]
Outside Parliament[edit]
Ewing was a vice president of equal rights charity Parity.[29] In April 2009, BBC Alba broadcast a biographical documentary Madame Ecosse, produced by Madmac Productions.[30] It was rebroadcast on BBC Scotland  to mark her 80th birthday.[16] Nicola Sturgeon named Ewing as her Political Hero on BBC News in 2018.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Winnie and Stuart Ewing had three children, two of whom also went on to a career in politics: their son, Fergus Ewing, was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and went on to hold several cabinet posts. Their daughter, Annabelle Ewing, was an MP from 2001 to 2005 and was elected an MSP in 2006.[4] Ewing died at her home in Bridge of Weir on 21 June 2023, at age 93.[5][31]
Awards and honours[edit]
In 1990 she was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.[2] In 2003 the Law Society of Scotland made her an honorary member.[32] She was awarded honorary LLD degrees from the University of Glasgow in 1995 and the University of Aberdeen in 2004.[33] She was awarded Doctor of the University degrees from the Open University in 1993[34] and the University of Stirling in 2012.[35] In 2009, a portrait of her painted by David Donaldson in 1970 was lent to the Scottish Parliament and put on display.[36]
