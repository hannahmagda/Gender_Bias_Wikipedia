# Gender bias in Wikipedia Biographies of German Politicians
## Hannah Schweren, Master of Data Science for Public Policy, 2024

This repository hosts the code for my master thesis as a student of the Master of Data Science for Public Policy at Hertie School. The scripts are split in a order to 
1. Aquire the wikipedia data that I am working with
2. Clean the data and apply a matching strategy
3. Conduct a descriptive analysis of the data
4. Visualise those desciptive parameters
5. Conduct a PMI analysis and save the resutls in the folder pmi_lists - these leists were then annotaded manually
6. The results of the pmi analysis are visualized and saved in the folder visualisations

The raw and cleaned data is too big for github and can thus be found in this google drive foulder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gEd6ji1lLCFKnp0cOyAHSK_YQGQGXnXs?q=sharedwith:public%20parent:1gEd6ji1lLCFKnp0cOyAHSK_YQGQGXnXs
