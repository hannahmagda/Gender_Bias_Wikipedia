# Gender bias in Wikipedia Biographies of German Politicians
## Hannah Schweren, Master of Data Science for Public Policy, 2024

This repository hosts the code for my master thesis as a student of the Master of Data Science for Public Policy at Hertie School. The scripts are split in a order to 
**1. Aquire the wikipedia data** that I am working with
**2. Clean the data** and apply a matching strategy
**3. Conduct a descriptive analysis** of the data and visualise the results
**4. Conduct a PMI analysis** and save the resutls in the folder pmi_lists - these leists were then annotaded manually
**5. visualisation of the results** of the pmi analysis

The raw and cleaned data is too big for github and can thus be found in this google drive foulder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gEd6ji1lLCFKnp0cOyAHSK_YQGQGXnXs?q=sharedwith:public%20parent:1gEd6ji1lLCFKnp0cOyAHSK_YQGQGXnXs
